<h4 class="benefits__typography--h5 text-center mb-4">#strongtogether</h4>

<p>The Kankakee Community College (KCC) Foundation presents <strong>GIVE DAY 2020 #strongtogether</strong>. GIVE DAY is the one day that alumni, families, students, staff, faculty, and friends unite to support one common goal: supporting the Kankakee Community College Mission&mdash;<strong><em>enhancing the quality of life through learning.</em></strong></p>
  
<p>The KCC Foundation would like to acknowledge that this year’s event is
  happening during a very challenging time in our community. Given the unprecedented changes occurring on
  our campus and the impact of the pandemic on our community, it feels right to unite our college community
  and supporters in a common effort. We also know that our students need our support more than ever.
  <strong>100% of your gift will have a direct and immediate impact on KCC students.</strong></p>
    
<p>We sincerely hope that you consider helping make KCC’s GIVE DAY
  #strongtogether a success. Any gift, no matter what the size, can change lives. <strong>You can designate
  which
  fund you would like your donation to benefit:</strong></p>
