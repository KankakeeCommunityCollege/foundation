During his career, the Honorable Michael Kick was dedicated to upholding justice in the court system. Kick was state's attorney for Kankakee County for five years. He then served as a judge and chief judge for the 21st Judicial Circuit, from 2000 until retiring in 2020. Both before and since his retirement, Kick has served on and supported the KCC Foundation Board, which works to create opportunities in education. He also has volunteered as a mentor to students in KCC's Paralegal program, and he has taught law classes at both KCC and Governors State University.

As a judge, he wanted to preside over drug and juvenile courts because it "provided the best hope to make a difference in somebody's life before it was too late,” Kick said. “To me, everybody's a human being. We all have the same wants, needs and desires. So, I never looked at someone who is charged with a crime as necessarily a bad human being. They were just a person who was charged with a crime."

Kick enrolled at KCC immediately after high school. He dropped out after one semester because he wasn’t ready to commit to college. He worked minimum wage labor jobs, which he hated. When his father passed away unexpectedly at age 49, money became an issue for Kick, his mother, and seven siblings. He re-entered KCC with new determination and worked overnights loading trucks.

“KCC allowed me to obtain a quality and affordable education, while living at home, after my father's death,” Kick said. “At KCC, I developed self-discipline, self-confidence and excellent study habits, which enabled my success at U of I and ultimately, law school. With the support of excellent teachers at KCC, I also developed an intellectual curiosity as well as a passion for learning. My time at KCC was—and still is—my favorite educational experience.”

After graduating from KCC in 1977, Kick attended University of Illinois.

He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1980, got married, started law school and worked at the Kankakee County Public Defender's Office. Several years later, Kick's wife, Lisa, experienced major health setbacks. He worked tirelessly while also caring for his beloved wife and two daughters. On May 14, 1995, Lisa Kick received a heart, kidney, and pancreas transplant, the first patient with this combination of transplants in Illinois history. She survived another pancreas transplant and lead a fulfilling life before succumbing to the ravages caused by diabetes in December 2018.

Kick's life story is one of resilience. Throughout, he stood alongside his loved ones as they fought through obstacles of their own. He modeled himself as not only a successful judge, but as an avid seeker of truth who is recognized for his ability to always see the humanity in people. Kick continues to benefit KCC and the district that we serve through his personal and professional contributions.
