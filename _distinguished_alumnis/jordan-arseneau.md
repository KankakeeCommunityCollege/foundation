​Growing up, Jordan Arseneau and his twin brother, Jesse, spent hours making films. "From the moment my brother Jesse and I started messing around with video cameras, we knew we wanted careers involving media. But coming from a family where neither of our parents graduated from college, we were unsure of where to start.”

Jordan and Jesse were part of a single parent household and they knew early on they would be responsible for paying for their own education. Jordan met with several KCC faculty members and weighed his options before choosing KCC.

Both brothers began at KCC in 2000 following graduation from Kankakee Trinity Academy.

While attending KCC, Jordan’s interests were piqued when he took his first speech class, “I remember thinking, ‘I definitely would like to do something in the communication field.’” Jordan earned an associate degree from KCC in 2002 and a bachelor’s degree in mass communications from Illinois State University in 2004. He has since climbed the ranks in broadcasting and filmmaking. Jordan now works as a photographer and editor at Tribune Broadcasting, where his main assignment is for Chicago’s Best, a food show which airs on WGN.

Jordan has proven himself to be one of the best, too, and has been awarded three Emmy awards from the Chicago/Midwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The awards are a 2011 Emmy for Outstanding Achievement for Magazine Programming as part of Chicago’s Best; and 2013 and 2014 individual awards for editor of a non-news program for work on Chicago’s Best.

“I firmly believe that KCC is the best educational option in Kankakee County. The education and career guidance I received in my short time there was instrumental in my success. I wouldn’t be where I am today without Kankakee Community College.”

Jordan is committed to education and he mentors students who are interested in broadcasting. Jordan has even helped his wife develop a media program in the Lansing school district that she teaches called “Mustang Media.” Jordan and his wife, Nikki, have two sons, Cameron and Ian.

Work is often viewed as “the daily grind.” Not for KCC graduate Jordan Arseneau. He describes work as “spending the day at the playground for a kid."
