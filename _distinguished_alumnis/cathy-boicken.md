A 1993 graduate of KCC, Cathy Boicken has built a very successful career in banking. She has dedicated significant time and talent to our community, and is an involved parent with her teenage daughter.

Boicken has advanced through the ranks at Municipal Bank in Bourbonnais over the past 30 years, beginning as a secretary. Today she is president of Municipal Bank.

She returned to school in the early 1990s, and graduated with honors from Kankakee Community College with an associate in arts degree. Boicken went on to earn a bachelor of arts degree and graduated summa cum laude from Olivet Nazarene University.

As an active community volunteer, Boicken has led a number of charitable initiatives. Most notably, she served for almost 15 years on the board of Hospice of Kankakee Valley, including terms as vice president and president.

She chaired Hospiceâ€™s annual Playhouse Raffle for four years, raising more than $30,000 to aid in the establishment of palliative care services and shepherded the organization through significant growth in its delivery of services to patients and their families.

Boicken also served on the board of a local chamber of commerce, and chaired its annual Leadership Development Institute.

Boicken is a consummate professional, a community leader, a dedicated wife and mother, and graduate of whom we are most proud. Her achievements and service to others mesh perfectly with the values of KCC, and the spirit of this award.
