**Breaking Barriers: How Yamei Rohlfs Achieved Her Dreams Through Resilience and Hard Work**

Originally from China, Yamei Rohlfs moved to Watseka 11 years ago to be with her husband.

Facing language barriers and a desire to join the workforce, she enrolled in classes at Kankakee Community College’s Watseka extension center and completed a GED in 2015. Nine years later, she holds a master’s degree and oversees intake departments for three drug and rehab centers nationwide.

“Getting my GED was one of the toughest things I’ve ever done,” Yamei said. “It actually took me four attempts to pass the language test, and I almost gave up. But something kept pushing me forward.”

After earning her GED, Yamei completed an associate degree at KCC while raising her two-year-old daughter and working as a front-desk representative for Riverside Medical Center. This role marked her first step into healthcare, and fueled her desire to continue learning. Soon, she enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program in healthcare administration at Western Governors University, which she completed online.

“I would go to work, then class, then get home, say goodnight to my daughter, and study until midnight,” Yamei said. “Sometimes, I’d wake up at 4 a.m. to get more work done before the day even started.”

Yamei credits her husband as her greatest source of support.

“He encouraged me every step of the way,” she said. “Knowing he believed in me made all the difference.”
 
During her time at KCC, Yamei was awarded the Century Scholarship, which covered most of her tuition, leaving only book expenses. 
 
“I’m incredibly grateful for the financial support,” she said. “Attending the awards event was a truly special and memorable experience.”
 
By 2022, Yamei started a career with Banyan Treatment Center, an inpatient drug and alcohol rehab center. She finds meaning in supporting individuals during critical life transitions.
 
“It’s a life-or-death moment for many of these people,” Yamei said. “I can’t imagine doing anything else.”
 
After finishing a master’s degree at Western Governors University, she was promoted to intake case management supervisor, overseeing locations in Illinois, Colorado and beyond.
 
Yamei credits KCC’s support and resources as instrumental in her success.
 
“The faculty at KCC were so encouraging. Mrs. Mann, for instance, went above and beyond to make sure I had the support I needed,” she said.
 
Yamei also appreciated the practical guidance provided by KCC’s writing lab.
 
“I had wonderful people cheering me on every step of the way,” Yamei said. “KCC’s writing lab helped me improve my language skills, teaching me to understand edits and apply them in my future writing. They even suggested helpful grammar software.”
 
Yamei also hosts foreign exchange students, a role she finds deeply fulfilling. As someone who came to the U.S. from China, she values the opportunity to provide a warm, supportive environment for international students. Additionally, she helps place other students with host families in the Watseka area, seeing it as a way to foster cultural exchange and give back to the community.
 
Now, Yamei enjoys staying connected with KCC through community initiatives.
 
“KCC sponsors the farmer’s market I started in Watseka, which is such a fulfilling way to give back,” she said. “And, as an alderwoman in my community, I love advocating for people just like KCC’s staff once advocated for me.”
 
Looking back, Yamei encourages others to take that first step, even if it’s just enrolling in one class.
 
“Sometimes you think, ‘Can I really do this?’ And then you realize it’s not about perfection but about perseverance,” she noted. “One class led me to an associate’s degree, which led to a bachelor’s, and then a master’s. So just start. You never know where it’ll take you.”
