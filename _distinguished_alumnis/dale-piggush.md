Dale Piggush graduated from Kankakee Community College’s Carpentry Apprenticeship Program in 1975. After working for other construction companies, he started his own Piggush Simoneau, Inc. in 1991, and initially worked out of his garage. Hard work and dedication, plus a thoughtful approach to the needs of clients allowed the firm to grow. Today, Piggush Simoneau is very successful, and builds a number of large construction projects in Kankakee County. Among the most recent is the Advanced Technology Education Center at Kankakee Community College, completed in 2019.&nbsp;

“Kankakee Community College gave me the foundation and the roots to live and build my dream of construction,” Piggush said. “When I was young, I always knew that I would build. Kankakee Community College afforded me the opportunity to pursue that dream close to home. It is an honor and a privilege that I use my education to make a difference in my community. I am proud to have constructed schools, hospitals, churches, and other local entities, but my legacy will begin with the foundation of my education at Kankakee Community College.”&nbsp;

Piggush’s community involvement includes serving as president of the Kankakee Contractors Association since 1996. He also has served on the Advisory Board for Presence Intergenerational Center and on the Board of Directors of the Catholic Education Foundation of the Diocese of Joliet. Along with his wife, Lynn, the Piggushs were honored as Humanitarians of the Year by Presence St. Mary’s Hospital in 2006. They also were inducted to the Hammes Hall of Honor at Bishop McNamara Catholic High School in 2017.

The Piggushs help current KCC students through annual financial support to the KCC Foundation Century Scholars fund and Women’s Giving Circle.&nbsp;<br>“(KCC) is where I learned the importance of giving back,” Piggush said. “Volunteering my time and talent to our great community has helped me achieve more personal success than I could have dreamed possible.”
