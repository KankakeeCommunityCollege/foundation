Steve DePasquale was born and raised in Bourbonnais. As a student, he worked full-time at night while attending KCC. He completed an associate degree in 1989 at 27 years old and was the first in his family to graduate from college.

After KCC, Steve transferred to Illinois State University, where he earned both a bachelor's degree (1991) in history and a master's degree (1993). He served as a teaching assistant while doing graduate work at ISU. After working for several years as an adjunct history professor, Steve was hired as a full-time history professor at KCC in 2003.

For over a decade, Steve has been a leader among his peers. He has held leadership roles in retention, assessment, and college readiness. Since 2005, Steve has served as representative on the Faculty Advisory Council to the Illinois Board of Higher Education. He also is the current president of the KCC Faculty Association.

Steve is committed to enriching educational experiences through history, culture and world affairs for KCC students and the community. He was a key collaborator on a French Canadian Heritage Wall at KCC that pays tribute to the primary cultural group that settled Kankakee County and the surrounding area.

Steve is one of three KCC professors who sponsors and leads intellectual discussions each semester about historical and political issues. Most recently, the group discussed Policraticus by John of Salisbury and The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli. Steve also was recently nominated by the KCC Foundation for the Illinois Community College Trustees Association Distinguished Alumnus Award.
