          <p>For most of our students, financial assistance is needed to attend college. Your support enables our students to achieve their college education. Our newest fundraising event raises critical dollars to support students via scholarships, grants and assists with unmet needs. The inaugural event was held on August 25, 2018 and was a success! The event featured Creme of the Crop catering and the Nick Lynch Band.  Nucor Steel of Kankakee was our lead sponsor. The event raised over $70,000! Thank you to all of our generous sponsors.</p>
