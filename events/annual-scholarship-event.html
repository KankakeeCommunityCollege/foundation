            At the annual scholarship event, scholarship recipients and those who donated to their scholarship have the
            opportunity to meet. Recipients share their appreciation with donors and talk more about their plans for the future.
            Donors are able to see firsthand the impact their donations made and how their contributions transformed
            students&apos; lives.
