        <p>When you establish a scholarship, you change lives. A scholarship donor may designate a set of specific criteria for scholarships that they choose to fund.  Below are the three types of scholarships:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Annual</strong>​ - A scholarship donated annually to establish and/or maintain a fund. The minimum contribution for an annual scholarship is $1,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Temporarily Restricted</strong> - These funds are restricted for a specific purpose for five or more years until depleted. The minimum​ amount to establish a temporarily restricted fund is $5,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Endowed</strong> - An endowed scholarship is perpetual. The principle remains intact and only the interest is awarded. The minimum contribution for an endowed scholarship is $25,000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, there is an increasing demand to fulfill the following scholarship needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Books</li>
          <li>Health Careers</li>
          <li>Out-of-district students</li>
          <li>Manufacturing</li>
          <li>Part-time students (the majority of KCC students attend part-time)</li>
          <li>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)</li>
          <li>Students who are not eligible for financial aid</li>
          <li>Supplies: art, health careers and welding.</li>
        </ul>
