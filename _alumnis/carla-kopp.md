**From Foster Care to Board Game Entrepreneur: Carla Kopp's Story of&nbsp;Inspiration**

Raised as a foster child in Kankakee County, Carla Kopp faced a challenging childhood. The uncertainty and instability of her early years instilled in her a profound sense of resilience and a determination to overcome obstacles. Kankakee Community College provided the springboard Carla needed to launch a fulfilling career and a thriving business.

"KCC was within driving distance of my foster home in Ashkum," Carla recalls. "But, the scholarship that paid for everything really made the decision easy." 

In addition to financial support, and guidance, the Baccalaureate Scholars program facilitated camaraderie among scholarship recipients through shared classes and community service projects, Carla said. It provided Kopp with a profound sense of belonging,

“Carla was one of the best,” said Susan LaMore, who coordinated the program. “She was super smart and very hard working. She took as many classes as she could while at KCC and did terrific in them.”

Shortly after starting at KCC, Carla made another big change. She turned 18, and her foster parents adopted her. Carla credits her adoptive parents for empowering her to pursue her passions and take risks in her career.

“My adoptive parents always encouraged me to do the best at anything related to school and to not settle for what I had,” Carla said. “There was always something that could be improved on and I think it's that outlook on life that's gotten me to try new things and to not just sit back and let life go by.”

In 2008, Carla graduated from KCC with an Associate in Engineering Science degree. She went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in 2010; and a master’s degree in electrical engineering, specializing in control theory, from the University of Alabama, Huntsville, in 2013. 

Her master’s degree concentration was to design and analyze systems that control various processes or machines, such as the science behind stabilizing rockets. 

“I remember being so excited for her because she was on her way to becoming a female engineer—the first female Baccalaureate Scholar to pursue that path and one of a small number of female engineering students at the University of Illinois,” LaMore said. “And she did it. I was so proud of her then and I still am as I learn all that she has achieved.”

Carla’s first job out of college was creating unmanned aerial vehicles for a government contractor in Huntsville, Alabama. Even though she said it was interesting, Carla’s love for games led her down a different path.

Today, based in Houston, Carla owns [Weird Giraffe Games](https://weird-giraffe-games.square.site/){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' }, a board and card game publishing company dedicated to inclusivity and accessibility.

“A lot of control theory is about how robots move,” Carla said. “Since solo-playable board games function like a kind of analog robot, my background in engineering proved to be a perfect fit for the world of game design.” 

At Weird Giraffe Games, Carla conceives the games, collaborates with creators to publish their work and oversees day-to-day operations. 

At KCC, Carla learned key lessons she continues to use. Enrolled along with other Baccalaureate Scholars, one of Carla’s first classes included public speaking. She said it was pivotal to overcoming her introverted nature and gaining confidence to share her knowledge. Now, she often gets invited to speaking engagements, and does not hesitate to accept. Carla also credits KCC for her keen problem-solving abilities – a critical asset for any business owner.

Carla now has her dream job doing something she loves, in addition to having a family that loves and supports her endeavors.

Carla advises anyone considering KCC, "If you're unsure of your path, KCC is a great place to explore your options without breaking the bank. The supportive community will help you achieve your goals."
