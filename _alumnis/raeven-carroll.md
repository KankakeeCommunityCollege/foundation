**Lights, Camera, Education: Raeven Carroll’s Rise from KCC to the Chicago Stage**
 
Raeven Carroll's love for acting began at an early age, but it wasn't until she attended a live performance of Sweeney Todd in high school that her path truly crystallized. 

"I remember sitting in the audience, completely mesmerized," she said. "The energy, the storytelling, the emotion—it was like a lightbulb went off, and I knew then that acting was my calling." 
 
Now, Raeven is performing at Chicago's Black Ensemble Theatre in Blue Eyed Soul Sung by Brown Eyed People and will be taking the stage at Drury Lane in the spring for Beautiful: A Carole King Musical.

Before her rise in Chicago’s theater scene, Raeven understood the importance of a solid academic foundation to pursue her passion. She started at KCC, where she earned a 3.94 GPA and a Presidential Scholarship that allowed her to transfer to Millikin University. She graduated from Millikin with a degree in Fine Arts Acting in 2023 and kept her debt to a minimum.
Raeven was involved in Upward Bound during high school, and the program laid the foundation for critical skills like leadership, time management, and collaboration—skills she continues to rely on in her acting career today.
"Upward Bound provided the resources and guidance I needed to explore colleges, apply for scholarships, and fully prepare for the next steps in my education," Raeven said. "It was an invaluable experience that helped set the stage for my success."
One of Raeven’s most eye-opening experiences at KCC was a class that showed the technical side of filmmaking. 

"As an actor, understanding things like lighting, camera angles, and how color choices affect the final product really opened my eyes," she said. "It made me think about how every detail contributes to the story we’re telling."
 
She also fondly recalls her children’s literature class, where she read to kids at a public library. 

"Seeing their reactions, especially to stories that reflected diverse cultures, reminded me just how powerful representation is in art," she said.
 
The support Raeven received from KCC’s faculty was key to her growth. She credits her professors in public speaking, sociology, and psychology for helping her both academically and personally. 

"The professors at KCC were different," Raeven said. "Their passion made me excited to learn and gave me the courage to keep going. They changed how I viewed education, and helped me build confidence for future academic relationships."
 
Raeven was also deeply impacted by a Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society project she worked on to create a film about domestic violence. 

"That project strengthened my research and organizational skills, but it also taught me the power of storytelling to raise awareness and bring about change," she reflected.
 
Now an actor in Chicago with several upcoming plays, Raeven draws on the lessons she learned at KCC every day. 

"Leadership, time management, collaboration—these are things I learned at KCC, and I use them all the time in my acting career," she shared. "Whether it's managing rehearsals or working with a director and cast, those skills have helped me navigate the demands of being on stage and working in the professional world of acting."
 
Looking back, Raeven describes KCC as more than just a stepping stone—it was home.  

"KCC wasn’t just a place where I studied; it was a place where I felt supported and could really grow," she said. "I spent countless hours there, working on projects, surrounded by a community that believed in me. It felt like home."
 
For anyone considering KCC, Raeven has simple advice: "Take your time, be open, and enjoy the experience. KCC is more than just a college—it’s a place where you can build a foundation for whatever your future holds."
