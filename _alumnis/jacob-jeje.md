Jacob relocated his family from Nigeria to New York for better opportunities and eventually, they settled in Illinois to be close to relatives. “I was working some crappy jobs, which I did not like. I thought about the American dream, that I could decide what I wanted to do, go to college, and get the training I needed to sustain myself and my family.”

Jacob decided to take the leap and enrolled in classes at KCC. At first, he tried studying to be a nurse but it didn’t turn out the way he hoped. “I talked with my academic advisor and she encouraged me to focus on the general education courses. Not only did her advice help me stay in school but through those courses, I found my career path.” Jacob switched to KCC’s Manufacturing Technology program, and then the real challenge began.

In between a full course load, a fulltime manufacturing job, and another part time job, Jacob was also a husband and a father. “It was rough, really rough. I got about 4.5 hours of sleep every day.”

Jacob didn’t always get the perfect grades he wanted because he had to balance his many responsibilities. But he wasn’t alone. “My wife has always been super supportive. There were days when I wanted to drop some classes and she would say, ‘Just keep going, just keep going.’” And he did, earning a spot on the honors list in 2016.

Jacob completed the KCC associates program and transferred to Governors State University, becoming the first person in his family to graduate with a bachelor’s degree. He now works at Pactiv, a manufacturing company. The short commute gives him more time to be with his three kids. He’s currently taking classes for a Master’s degree in Supply Chain Management. “I’m taking it slow this time, and thinking of my long-term goal.”

As he looks back over an intense journey, Jacob says, “If you don’t have a bigger drive beyond just going to school, you’ll be tempted to drop out. Passion keeps you moving but without a long-term goal, you’ll end up with a degree you can’t get a job with. It’s about balancing all three: passion, drive, and a long-term goal.”
