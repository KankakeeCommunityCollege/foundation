**Lindy Casey: Shaping Community Through Communication**

Lindy Casey grew up in Bourbonnais, raised by a single mother who instilled values of humility, determination, and hard work in her. After high school, many of Lindy’s friends headed off to four-year universities.

“I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do,” she said. “Financially, we could not afford a big university, and I did not know what my options were. So I took a couple years off to figure things out.”

In 2007, she enrolled at Kankakee Community College. Her initial plan was to become a dental hygienist. While studying at KCC, she worked in a dental office to get hands-on experience and quickly realized it was not the right fit.

“I am really grateful I had the chance to explore that,” she said. “And I was equally grateful that KCC gave me the space to keep moving forward while I searched for the right direction.”

While at KCC, Lindy rekindled her love of reading and writing. One course, in particular, became a turning point.

“Our class worked together to create a school magazine,” Lindy recalled. “I chose to write about fall fashion, which seems funny now, but at the time, I loved it. That assignment gave me a glimpse of what it could be like to write professionally. It lit a spark.”

After earning an Associate of Arts from KCC in 2010, Lindy transferred to Columbia College Chicago to study magazine journalism. A year later, she expanded her focus by transferring to Governors State University, to complete a bachelor’s degree in communications with a concentration in advertising and public relations.

“Looking back, it all fits together,” Lindy said. “Each step gave me more clarity. KCC gave me the foundation, Columbia showed me what I did and did not want, and Governors State helped me pull it all together into a field that really suits me.”

Today, Lindy is the communications director for the Village of Bourbonnais. She was the first person ever hired into a dedicated marketing role for the municipality. Over the last eight years, she has helped grow a department that now includes a team and oversees a wide range of community-facing communications—from social media and press releases to speeches, events, and more.

“I wear a lot of hats, and I love that,” she said. “Everything that gets written, posted, or shared with the public comes through my office. It is a lot of responsibility, but it is also a privilege.”

Lindy’s work helped support the grand opening of a new 12.5-acre outdoor venue, The Grove, which has quickly become a hub for community events. Her role has expanded alongside the Village’s vision for community engagement.

“I am passionate about bringing people together and helping them feel informed, connected, and proud of where they live,” she said. “That passion started here, and I am lucky to live and work in the same place where I grew up.”

Looking back, she remembers how much KCC shaped her.

“I was living on my own and working full-time while going to school,” she said. “There were times I struggled with time management. One of my English instructors asked me to stay after class and check in. It was not disciplinary—it was caring. That conversation changed my attitude. I realized people here really wanted me to succeed.”

Lindy was inducted into Phi Theta Kappa, an academic honor society for community college students. It was an unexpected but motivating recognition.

“I was just trying to keep going,” she said. “Receiving that honor reminded me that hard work does get noticed.”

She describes the KCC campus as progressive, clean, and constantly improving.

“Even then, I could see how invested the college was in staying modern and creating opportunities for students. It has only continued to grow since.”

For those considering community college, Lindy is quick to offer encouragement.

“There is so much pressure in high school to know exactly what you want,” Lindy said. “But it is okay not to know. KCC gives you space to explore without the financial burden. You can start there and go anywhere. That is what I tell people all the time.”
