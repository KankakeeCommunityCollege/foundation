**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

Being a local resident, KCC was my preference for my educational needs. I was the first in my immediate family to attend and graduate with a college degree. I was a single parent of two children and KCC allowed me the opportunity to obtain a college degree at my own pace.

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

The flexibility of the class schedule and the location of the campus was key to my decision to attend KCC.

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

KCC has an AMAZING support system! The staff members go above and beyond to see that students succeed. KCC embraces every student and does everything possible to enhance the quality of life through learning. KCC has many resources available to help students on their path to graduation.

**What is your role in your position?**

I am the mailroom supervisor for the Physical Plant Department. My duties shipping and receiving, USPS mailing, Key control, vehicle reservations and many other duties.

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

The most rewarding part of my job is knowing I have an impact on students. I have student workers that work alongside me, and it is a joy to see them grow. Celebrating their accomplishments, whether it is achieving honor roll status, receiving a scholarship, or simply a job well done in their position is the greatest reward I could receive.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments that are most memorable?**

I have seen many events occur during my time as an employee at KCC. One that stands out in my mind is watching a student worker sign for a scholarship to attend Columbia College in Chicago. The look of pride on her and her father’s faces will be engraved in my memory for many years to come.
