KCC Staff Alumni<br>
Professor of Nursing<br>
’87 KCC Graduate

**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

I chose KCC after high school for several reasons. Due to health considerations, staying close to home was important to me. I also wanted a strong academic foundation for my future education in nursing. KCC allowed me to work while attending school and provided an affordable option without sacrificing the quality of my education.

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

I was able to stay home for health reasons, work and continue my education.

**Did you earn other degrees following KCC? If so, what degree(s), college, and year?**

I transferred to Lewis University and received my BSN in 1990. I received my MSN from ONU in 2014.

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

KCC provides a solid foundation for wherever you want to go.

**What is your role in your position?**

I am a Professor of Nursing. I teach theory and clinical for the CNA program. I also do clinical and demos in the RN program.

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

I love to see students grow and become successful as kind, professional CNAs.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments the at are most memorable?**

One of the most meaningful parts of my role is watching students interact with patients during clinicals and seeing their confidence grow. Giving students their completion letters at the end of the semester is a proud moment, but what stays with me most is when a student sincerely says, “Thank you.” I always respond, “You did this—I was here to guide you,” because their growth and success belong to them.
