**From Nursing Student to Chief Nursing Officer: Ellen Bollino’s Inspiring Path**

Ellen Bollino moved frequently as a child, attending nine different schools before eighth grade. She arrived at KCC after a year at Illinois State University.

At KCC, she said, there was finally a sense of belonging she had not experienced anywhere else.

“What I remember most about KCC are the people, the lasting relationships, and the incredible support I received within the program,” Ellen said. “After spending a year at a four-year school, I found the social dynamic at KCC to be a much better fit. I loved learning and growing alongside a core group of peers who shared the same purpose and aspirations.”

One moment that stood out was when, as a 19-year-old nursing student who was not eligible for financial aid and could not afford her textbooks, Dean Phyllis Nichols and her instructors lent Ellen the materials she needed until she could purchase them herself.

“That kind of compassion and community left a lasting impact on me,” she said. In 2001, Ellen earned an Associate Degree in Nursing from KCC, launching a career that has spanned more than two decades.

Ellen was inspired to choose KCC because her mother also graduated from KCC’s nursing program. Ellen wanted the same strong foundation. Even though she didn’t live in KCC’s district at the time, she chose it over her local community college.

“KCC’s nursing program had a 100% first-time pass rate for the National Council Licensure Examination, and the continuity of their clinical experiences really stood out,” she said.

The faculty and staff at KCC provided a strong balance of preparation for the licensure exam and hands-on training for bedside nursing. She remembers Mr. Mathis’ extremely high expectations in Anatomy and Physiology and Microbiology, Dot Bendix standing by her side as she gave her first flu shot to a Manteno Veteran’s Home resident, and Mrs. Clapp’s energetic, compassionate, and nurturing presence that all the students loved.

“They were patient as we learned concepts and skills while still holding us to the high standards of integrity and professionalism essential to the nursing profession,” Ellen said.

KCC’s close partnerships with local hospitals and health care teams gave Ellen valuable hands-on experience during clinical rotations—including acute bedside hospital care, long-term care, residential behavioral health, and federal health care facilities.

“Those experiences helped me understand where my strengths fit best while also giving me a fuller perspective of the health care continuum,” she said. “That insight has served me well as I’ve moved into leadership.”

After graduating, Ellen began her career at Riverside, where she advanced through a variety of nursing roles. She also completed bachelor’s and master’s degrees in nursing from Olivet Nazarene University. For a time, she held leadership positions in other organizations. In 2024, she returned to Riverside, first as director of nursing, then as chief nursing officer beginning in April 2025.

Over the years, Ellen said she has hired, onboarded, mentored, and coached countless newly graduated nurses, and KCC graduates stand out.

“They are consistently versatile and coachable while also possessing the technical and critical thinking skills essential to being successful, high-performing clinical team members,” she said.

Looking back, Ellen credits KCC with shaping more than her technical skills.

“KCC is more than an academic institution; it’s a trusted community organization built on diverse programming and strong partnerships with local industries and employers,” Ellen said. “The forward-thinking leadership and dedicated faculty truly live their mission of supporting student success.”

Her advice to future students is simple: “If you’re willing to put in the work, KCC will meet you with the support, education, and opportunities you need to reach your goals.”
