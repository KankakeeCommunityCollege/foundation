**From Family Tradition to Thriving Career: Christopher Both's Journey Starts at KCC**

Inspired by his family’s legacy, Christopher Both discovered his calling in banking. Growing up in Watseka, a rural Illinois community, he heard stories about his father and grandfather, both loan officers dedicated to supporting local farmers and businesses. It ignited a passion for banking within him at a young age.

"From the time I was in first grade, my mom would ask me at the end of each school year what I wanted to be when I grew older," Christopher recalled. "And with the exception of one year wanting to be a park ranger after a trip to Yellowstone, I always said ‘banker.’"

Now a senior vice president and chief loan officer at Kentland Bank, specializing in commercial and agricultural loans, Christopher proudly carries on his family’s tradition of helping farmers and business owners achieve their dreams. During his career, Christopher has helped open new businesses, enabled young farmers to start their operations, expanded existing businesses and farm operations, and helped develop community initiatives.

“I chose to start my college career at KCC because it offered a quality education, close to home,” said Christopher. “And I was selected to be a part of the Baccalaureate Scholars program which offered a scholarship and leadership development opportunities.

“Unlike the large lecture halls of a four-year university, KCC professors knew my name and took a genuine interest in my success,” he said.

One of Christopher’s most memorable experiences at KCC was a speech class taught by Alice “Tinker” Parker. "There was one thing that sticks in my mind," he said. "She always said 'know your audience.' I think back on that in everything I do, both professionally and personally."

“Chris, one of my favorite students, stood out for his brightness and challenging nature. I was impressed by his creativity and exceptional critical thinking skills,” Parker said. “He was also focused on his goals. I knew he was going to be successful. I'm incredibly proud of Chris' accomplishments in such a short span.”

In 2012, Christopher graduated from KCC with a transfer degree with a concentration in psychology. He transitioned to Franklin University in Columbus, Ohio, through a 3+1 program that allowed him to complete a bachelor’s degree in business administration in a little over a year.

"The general education classes you take at KCC give you a broad understanding of how different topics tie together," he said. "Even though I majored in psychology, having that well-rounded education has been helpful in my career." 

Christopher said his understanding of psychology has helped him to assess and build strong, trust-based relationships with his clients, much like his father and grandfather did.

KCC was about more than academics for Christopher. He met his future wife, Kailei, in Abnormal Psychology class. Textbooks were used in their engagement photos, a symbol of how their journey together began.

Through the international academic honor society, Phi Theta Kappa, Christopher volunteered for Food from the Heart, distributing Christmas dinner baskets to families in need across Iroquois County.

"It was very fulfilling," Christopher reflected, "I learned a lot about our community and its resources. I love to volunteer. I love being active in the community. That's something that KCC allowed me to continue, staying at home and participating in community activities.

“I give credit to KCC for empowering me with the knowledge and skills I needed to reach my goal of helping my community thrive,” said Christopher. Today, he demonstrates his dedication to community development by actively participating in groups like the Kiwanis Club of Watseka and Watseka Masonic Lodge, by assisting local individuals and businesses with their finances, and by continuing to volunteer with the local food pantry.

"I would argue that the quality of education you're going to get at KCC is as good, if not better, than any four-year degree," Christopher said. "It's a great place to explore your future possibilities. Your journey starts here."

By supporting local farmers and businesses, Christopher honors his family's tradition and ensures its impact reaches future generations.
