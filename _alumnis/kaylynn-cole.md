<h4 class="blue-heading-small">What is your favorite memory of KCC?</h4>
My favorite memory at KCC would be working with Laura Gardner on different campus projects. Thanks to her, I was able to become more involved with campus life and all the activities offered. I was on the Students’ Activities Board and served as secretary for one semester. I also was involved with TRIO and worked with Kim and Delithia. They helped me get books, were my advisors, and took me to visit many different campuses to find a place to transfer and continue my education.

KCC really allowed me to grow and helped point me toward my current success. I was a student worker for one year in the KCC Foundation office. I was an office assistant. I learned so much from Foundation Director Kelly Myers that has really helped me in the professional world today. I assisted with coordinating events and with scholarship donor relations. Not only did I learn the basics of working in an office setting, I also grew as a professional. I am eternally grateful for this experience, because having this on my resume helped me achieve my current position as a Sporting Consultant with Nestle Purina.

<h4 class="blue-heading-small">How did KCC pave the path to where you are today?</h4>
I graduated from Kankakee Community College in May 2014 with an Associates in Arts Degree. From there, I transferred to Indiana University Southeast in New Albany, Indiana. I graduate this May with a bachelor’s degree in business with a concentration in marketing, a minor in public relations, and a certification in sales. While finishing my degrees, I was married and had my son, Tucker.

I am proud of my decision to attend KCC. Not only for the financial and close-to-home benefits of attending a community college but also because of the doors it opened for me. The experiences I gained at KCC and the people I met along the way continue to benefit me and keep me on a path to success. It seems after making the right decision to attend KCC there has been an unending chain of positive events in my career. Since I am the first in my family to receive a college degree, I had no clue where to start to continue my education. Thanks to KCC and its wonderful staff, I was able to fulfill a dream and brighten my future.
