**Ocqua Murrell: Defying Limits, Elevating Education**

From community college to a Ph.D. and an award-winning professorship, Ocqua Murrell exemplifies resilience, determination, and a commitment to education.

She enrolled at KCC in January 2013, balancing work and school to complete an associate degree in just three semesters. As a Baccalaureate Scholar, Ocqua found the structure and support to propel her forward.

But the path wasn’t easy.

"I initially planned to join the Marine Corps, but when that path didn’t feel right, I had to rethink everything," Ocqua said. "My father wasn’t willing to pay for college, so I needed an affordable, high-quality option. KCC became that bridge, allowing me to build a strong foundation without drowning in debt."

Her sister, Akilah Stewart, worked at KCC and introduced Ocqua to Susan LaMore, a mentor who changed her trajectory.

"Susan didn’t just help me get into the Baccalaureate Scholars program—she made it possible,” Ocqua said. “I had missed the deadline, but when a spot opened, she fought to get me in and ensured I had the support to succeed. That changed my life."

“I would love to be in Ocqua’s classroom today!” LaMore said. “Once she found her path, she was determined and dedicated herself to achieving her goals. I admired her work ethic and am so happy for her today. I have no doubt she’s a fantastic professor whom students are lucky to learn from.”

After KCC, Ocqua transferred to the University of Southern Indiana, earning bachelor’s degrees in international studies (2016) and anthropology (2017). She later completed a graduate certificate in nonprofit management at Post University before earning a master’s in sociology at Virginia Tech, where she also earned a postgraduate certificate in women’s and gender studies. In 2023, Ocqua completed a Ph.D. in sociology.

That same year, Ocqua accepted a role as assistant professor in the Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies department at the University of Florida. Shortly after, she earned the university’s 2025 College Teaching/Advising Award in Women’s Studies.

"I love what I do," Ocqua said. "Teaching isn’t just a job—it’s a calling. I get to inspire students the way my professors inspired me. It’s especially important for me to show Black and brown students that community college isn’t a fallback—it’s a smart, strategic first step toward success."

Ocqua credits KCC for preparing her for academia, particularly through her experience in the writing lab, where she discovered her passion for teaching.

"Working in the writing lab taught me patience and clarity, helping me guide students through their writing struggles," she said. "That experience showed me I had a gift for education."

She remembers her professors as instrumental. Rexann McKinley made English rigorous yet rewarding, while Scott Kistler’s Latin American History course sparked a passion for deeper historical inquiry.

"(Scott) Kistler made history come alive,” Ocqua said. “He helped me see connections between past and present I’d never considered before. His teaching style still influences how I approach my students today."

“Ocqua was an enthusiastic and hard-working student,” Kistler said. “She was a genuine pleasure to have in class, because she had an obvious desire to learn and to produce good work. I didn’t know about the challenges that she faced, but I definitely saw her dedication to learning and to producing good work.”

Ocqua worked multiple jobs while earning her degree.

"That last semester was brutal," she said. "Between work and school, I barely had a moment to breathe. But I kept going because I knew where I wanted to be. I refused to give up."

A one-credit-hour yoga class offered an unexpected source of balance.

"That class saved me," she said. "Amid all the chaos, it gave me a moment to breathe. It reminded me that taking care of myself was just as important as working hard."

Ocqua describes KCC as a launchpad.

"The professors, the classmates, the atmosphere—it all made me feel like I belonged. Even when things got tough, I never felt alone. That support made all the difference."

Now, with a doctorate and a classroom full of students looking up to her, Ocqua is on a mission to show others that success isn’t about where you start, but how you rise.

"KCC prepared me for everything that followed,” Ocqua said. “The foundation I built there made me more than ready. Community colleges don’t get enough credit for the incredible education they provide."

Her advice to students: don’t chase prestige—chase opportunity.

"It’s easy to think success only comes from a big-name university, but that’s a myth,” Ocqua said. “What matters is the quality of your education and the doors it opens. KCC gave me everything I needed to succeed."

From KCC to a Ph.D., from working minimum-wage jobs to teaching at a top university, Ocqua redefined what is possible.

"I wouldn’t be where I am today without KCC," she said. "My story isn’t just about earning degrees—it’s about breaking barriers, defying expectations, and proving that no matter where you start, you can build a future greater than you ever imagined."
