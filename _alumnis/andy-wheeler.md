At age 25, Andrew Wheeler came to KCC to get a fresh start professionally. As an adult student, Wheeler wanted to complete his associate degree while working and building a foundation for further education.

“Originally, I thought that I would be teaching history at some small university nestled in the mountains somewhere,” he said. “But sometimes life takes over and you go down roads that you never thought you would travel. I never thought I would work in the media, but there I was in 2003, working for years as an editor at The Daily Journal, running a Business-to-Business publication and serving on their editorial board.”

Today, Wheeler has a deep investment in the community he grew up in. He oversees marketing at a large global company, and serves as chairman of the Kankakee County Board. &nbsp;

After completing a degree at KCC, Wheeler finished bachelor’s and master’s degrees focusing on journalism and the marketing side of the newspaper business. Along the way, he realized it was not going to lead to the career he had envisioned.&nbsp;

Since 2014, Wheeler has been vice president of marketing for Van Drunen Farms and its sister company, FutureCueticals, headquartered in Momence. These companies are industry leaders in the agricultural growth, research and development and manufacture of fruit, vegetable, and grain-based products for the functional food, cosmetics, and dietary supplement markets.

“I completed my degrees just in time for that entire business model to crash,” he said. “That led me to Van Drunen Farms. I guess the common thread is that if you can communicate, you will always have a path available for you.

“I am able to utilize the creative and strategic side for both marketing and as part of the leadership team for the company. I really enjoy the data side of business including finance, budgeting, manufacturing and, oddly enough, I find the legal side fascinating.”&nbsp;<br>Wheeler said an opportunity area for current students is the area of food safety auditing and management, with job opening because of changes to the law.

“The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has changed how those who manufacture have to get deeply involved in not only their own operations, but also their supplier’s operations. There is a need for analytical chemists as well. We are also in need of STEM skillsets and degreed office personnel, like accountants, comptrollers, finance people, and technical-minded salespeople.”

At KCC, Wheeler learned how to juggle being a student and full-time worker, which provided the discipline he needed to move forward professionally.&nbsp;

“KCC is a great place to sharpen not only your mental skills, but also bolster your internal drive to succeed in whatever way that the word ‘success’ means to you,” he said&nbsp;

As chairman of the county board, a position he was elected to in 2016, Wheeler says he enjoys fixing things, like poor finances within the county government and relationships that had become strained. He realizes that strengthening and maintaining relationships are critical skills that enable him to be successful.&nbsp;

“If people don’t feel like they are appreciated and have value, you will not get their best,” he said. “I really don’t like politicians, so I do my best not to be one. It’s not about me. I am a businessman helping reshape how government operates.”

Wheeler’s advice to students: “Go to community college first, before you drop tens of thousands of dollars figuring out that you don’t know what you want to do. Build your base, learn how to communicate professionally, and grow from there.”<br>&nbsp;
