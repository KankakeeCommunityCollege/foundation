**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

As a senior in high school, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. My parents encouraged starting at a junior college and then transferring. I liked the idea of smaller class sizes and a more affordable education. At the time my mom didn’t live far from KCC, so I was able to still live at home and concentrate on my courses. 

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

The small class sizes provided more individual attention from the professors. The college truly felt like a community that wanted me to succeed. There was student led organizations that I was able to join: TRIO, student council, and Phi Theta Kappa. I was also able to obtain a student worker position that worked around my class schedule. My first year at KCC, I was able to walk on to the softball team that received 3rd in the nation. KCC provides top notch professors, mentors, and coaches. KCC set me up for success as I transferred to UIUC.  

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

I have no regrets going to a community college first. I appreciate the opportunities KCC provides to all students. KCC truly set me up for success &mdash; I believe in KCC’s values and mission. I came back to KCC for a second degree and came back again as a professor.

**What is your role in your position?**

I am a Respiratory Therapy Program Director and a Phi Theta Kappa advisor. I keep up with the reporting of our program to our accreditation body, CoARC. I instruct courses throughout the program, keep track of the budget, report our outcomes to the college, and get to collaborate with other health care program directors to provide a great experience for all students! For Phi Theta Kappa (PTK), I help facilitate meetings among PTK members, encourage students to be involved and keep up with regional and leadership involvement opportunities.

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

Seeing students succeed is the most rewarding part of my position.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments that are most memorable?**

KCC offers their employees professional development opportunities. I look forward to our Summer Respiratory Forum that we are able to attend with other respiratory programs across the United States. Additionally, in 2019, our PTK students were recognized on stage in Orlando, Florida for their Honors in Action/research activity.
