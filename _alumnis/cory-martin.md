Cory Martin's journey to success began at Kankakee Community College, where he discovered his passion for welding, leading to a fulfilling career. A proud KCC ’16 alum, Cory reflects on the pivotal role the college played in his life.

"KCC was the compass that guided me to discover my passion for working with my hands," Cory shared, reflecting on his initial uncertainty about his career path.

Growing up in Manteno, Cory's educational journey started at Bishop McNamara Catholic High School. Without a clear career path in mind, Cory found inspiration within his family. His sisters, grandparents, and mother all attended KCC and truly enjoyed their experiences.

"My time at KCC significantly contributed to both my personal and professional growth,” Cory said. “It was more than acquiring knowledge for a career; it was a genuinely positive experience. The instructors at KCC were passionate about what they did, making the learning process enjoyable.”

Cory emphasizes the significance of job shadowing at KCC, a pivotal experience that solidified his decision to pursue welding. Through this hands-on learning, Cory decided to earn an associate in applied science degree in welding technology. In 2015, he earned the Student Chapter Member Award from the American Welding Society in recognition of outstanding school, community and industry achievements.

Cory works at Holland Manufacturing in Dolton as a tool and Die welder. His expertise also led to an invitation to teach basic welding at KCC. "Now, being part of the faculty at KCC, I find joy in passing on my knowledge to the next generation of welders,” Cory said. “It's a full-circle moment in my journey.”

A memorable moment at KCC for Cory was participating in FABTECH, billed as North America’s largest metal forming, fabricating, welding and finishing event. At the conference, Cory was part of a team of KCC students that finished third place in a welding competition featuring colleges from across the U.S. "I never imagined standing there with my team, receiving recognition in a competition at the FABTECH Expo. It was a surreal moment and a testament to the skills I honed at KCC," Cory recalled.

Cory appreciates that his welding instructors, Mike Spangler and Mark Stevenson, prepared him for the workforce with hands-on experiential learning, complementing theoretical knowledge with practical on-the-job approaches.

"During a time of uncertainty about my skills in welding, Mr. Spangler's encouragement and recommendation to pursue welding were crucial,” Cory said. “With his support, I gained the confidence to continue, earn my degree, and advance in the field."

Stevenson allowed Cory to shadow him at his workplace. “To be able to see firsthand how an experienced welder works was invaluable,” Cory recalls. “I learned useful tips and shortcuts, how to keep myself safe, and that extra work savvy you get from watching someone so proficient. I could not have paid enough to gain that firsthand experience.”

Cory also encourages prospective students to seek guidance, ask questions, and build connections, emphasizing that KCC is not just a college, but also a supportive community. “It was like every door you knock on, someone answers,” Cory said. “All questions got answered. Everyone wants to help you.”

From uncertainty to returning as a teacher, Cory's journey encapsulates the transformative impact of KCC.
