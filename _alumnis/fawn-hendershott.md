**Fawn Hendershott Credits KCC For Giving Her a Second Chance at Life**

Fawn Hendershott learned to balance single parenthood, a full-time job, and nursing school at Kankakee Community College with unwavering determination. 

After high school, Fawn initially pursued a degree in athletic training at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After a year and a half, she realized she no longer wanted to pursue athletic training.

"I came home to figure things out and I started with KCC where I was welcomed with open arms," she recalls.

At KCC, Fawn completed a Certified Nurse Assistant certification and an associate degree in nursing (2012). She then earned a bachelor’s degree in nursing in 2015 and a master of business administration degree in 2022, both from Western Governors University.

"The support and guidance I received from the faculty at KCC was phenomenal,” Fawn said. “Nursing was a tough program, but the camaraderie and encouragement helped me get through it."

While studying full-time at KCC, Fawn also worked full-time as a CNA at Saint Mary's Hospital in Kankakee. She then transitioned to Riverside Medical Center, where she worked on the telemetry and surgical units.

As a single mother, she studied into the night after putting her child to bed. Fawn also navigated the financial strain of managing household expenses and going to college on a limited income. 

“Juggling school, work, and motherhood was incredibly challenging,” Fawn reflects. “There were times I felt completely overwhelmed, but I kept reminding myself why I was doing it."

In 2015, Fawn found her calling when she joined Uplifted Care in Bourbonnais as a nurse case manager. Uplifted Care provides hospice and palliative care, as well as grief support, to people in six counties in Illinois.

"Within days of joining Uplifted Care, I had this overwhelming sense that this was exactly where I wanted to be,” Fawn shared. “This was my passion. I'm a hospice nurse through and through."

In 2018, she assumed the role of nurse team leader, followed by clinical staff educator and CNA supervisor. In 2022, Fawn was named executive director of Uplifted Care.

It’s a dream job, Fawn said.

"Caring for the dying has taught me so much about living,” she said. “It’s a beautiful thing to celebrate someone's life and bring families together. Hospice care eases suffering when there's no other option or when someone chooses to forego further treatment.”

As a recognized leader in her community, Fawn received the Athena Young Professional Award in 2023. This prestigious award honors individuals for professional excellence, community service, and for actively assisting women in their attainment of professional excellence and leadership skills.

"KCC gave me my second chance," Fawn said. "It set the foundation for achieving my greater purpose. Without their nursing program, I wouldn't be where I am today.

"If you're thinking about it, do it. The support and guidance you’ll receive are unparalleled. KCC helped me navigate life’s challenges, and it can do the same for you.”
