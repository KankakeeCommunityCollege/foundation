A KCC business graduate, Mike never planned on owning his own business but today, he is the proud owner of Fit Body U, a thriving gym in Bourbonnais, IL.

“I was backed into a corner,” Mike says. Before starting off on his own, he worked as a part-time independent contract trainer at a gym when management cut the trainers’ profit margin drastically. Suddenly, Mike found himself considering a potential career change.

Then he heard about a gym for sale. It was a good deal and with a friend investor, Mike collected the money for the purchase. “It just seemed like perfect timing. But I was flying by the seat of my pants.”

Within record time, Mike’s new gym was up and running. “I didn’t even have enough equipment for a full gym, but it was enough to get started.” As Fit Body U started making profits, Mike poured the money back into the gym for more equipment.

“I’ve learned to appreciate the idea of small beginnings. Some people want to start big and if they’re not sure about what they’re doing, they’ll fall on their face. That’s why I like starting small, and making corrections as I go.”

After working as an employee for 11 businesses, Mike enjoys putting his own ideas into practice. “If you work for someone else, you have to work for their vision. But now I can practice my own vision and see how the community responds to my ideas.”

Entrepreneurs are known for taking risks, but the risks have only proven to help Mike’s business. “There were times in my personal life that I didn’t take the risk and I missed out. But stepping out is always more fun. So now with the gym, I try to always take the risk.”

In the last two years, the gym has doubled from 450 to 810 active members. This coming summer, Mike is planning a big celebration for Fit Body U’s five-year anniversary.

“If you’re passionate about a business idea,” Mike says, “if that’s what you think about when you’re by yourself, then that’s what you should do. People around you will be inspired by your passion and things will come together. If you have consistency and passion, and if you’re always a student of the game, then it will happen.”
