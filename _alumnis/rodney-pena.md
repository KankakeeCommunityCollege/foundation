**Rodney Peña Jr.: From Uncertainty to Nursing Excellence**
 
Immediately after high school, Rodney Peña Jr. embarked on a path he had carefully planned: West Point Military Academy. During his first year, though, Rodney realized the military lifestyle wasn’t a fit for him. Resigning from West Point left him with an uncertain future. Meeting his future wife, Crystal, changed things.

Crystal, a 2005 KCC graduate, encouraged Rodney to take advantage of its programs.

“Meeting my wife changed everything,” Rodney said. “She believed I was too smart not to be in school, and she pushed me to go back. That’s how I ended up at KCC.”

At KCC, Rodney found a welcoming environment with flexibility. He explored courses across multiple disciplines, and completed a transfer degree in 2007. Next, he pursued nursing.

“The nursing program at KCC really stood out,” Rodney said. “It was challenging and hands-on, which I loved. The clinical rotations were an incredible experience, and the support from the instructors was amazing.”  
Rodney's passion for nursing quickly took shape. He earned another associate degree from KCC in 2013, a bachelor's degree from Chamberlain University, and master's degree from Walden University, ultimately becoming a nurse practitioner.

Today, Rodney oversees the Partial Hospitalization Program/Intensive Outpatient Program at  Advocate South Suburban Hospital in Hazel Crest, where he makes critical treatment decisions for mental health patients.
“Nursing is my calling,” Rodney said. “I’ve always been drawn to mental health, starting with my first job at a veterans’ home working in the Alzheimer’s and dementia unit. From there, I worked in various mental health settings, and it’s become my passion.”

Reflecting on his time at KCC, Rodney credited the supportive instructors and diverse student body for shaping his perspective.

“The professors really cared about your success, especially people like Mrs. King and Jenny Rogers, who made a huge impact on me,” he said. “And being around students from so many different backgrounds and ages helped me grow in ways I never expected.”

“He was in my very first clinical group as a new faculty member at KCC,” Rogers said. “Rodney always had a good joke or something to say to always put a smile on anyone’s face. He was always very good with his patients. It makes me extremely proud to see how far Rodney has come in his nursing career.”

“Stay flexible and open-minded,” is Rodney’s advice to students. “You might think you know exactly what you want, but sometimes life has other plans, and that’s okay. Don’t be afraid to try new things and step outside your comfort zone—you might find your true calling in the process. And don’t underestimate the power of building connections with your peers and instructors. Those relationships can be life-changing.”

Rodney credited KCC for providing more than just an education—it helped him discover his purpose.

“KCC gave me the foundation to succeed,” he said. “It wasn’t just about academics—it was about finding my path and becoming the person I was meant to be.”

Moving from a time of uncertainty to become a dedicated nurse practitioner, Rodney Peña Jr. dedicates his career to making a meaningful difference in the lives of others.
