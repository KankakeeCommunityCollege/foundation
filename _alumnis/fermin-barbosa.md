**Tattooing with Purpose: Fermin Barbosa's Artistic Story**

Fermin Barbosa is a passionate tattoo artist whose artistic journey began at KCC.

Though initially unsure about what his career direction would be, Fermin always knew he wanted to make a living through art.

After graduating from KCC in 2014, Fermin transferred to Governors State University and completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2018. Today, he operates a private tattoo studio in Kankakee.

Fermin said KCC provided access to quality materials and facilities that helped him refine his craft. He has fond memories of how KCC contributed to his growth as an artist, such as when he drew landscapes outside, using the beautiful riverfront for inspiration.

“Sketching along the river, especially in the fall with all the changing colors, was a highlight for me,” he said.

Transitioning from high school to college posed challenges for Fermin, especially in maintaining discipline and managing time. But, the TRIO Student Support Services program provided invaluable support and guidance from his counselor and instructors, he said.

“No one was there to remind me to finish my assignments on time; it was all on me,” Fermin said. “(TRIO) really kept me on track, especially when I was struggling with the transition from high school to college. Their encouragement made a big difference.”

One of the most impactful classes for Fermin was figure drawing.

“It unlocked something in me,” he said. “Those skills are essential in tattooing, especially when I’m drawing faces or full figures.”

Fermin balanced his studies with part-time jobs, which taught him discipline and responsibility.

“I worked at KCC as a student worker, which allowed me to meet a lot of people and understand different aspects of the school,” he said.

Among his notable achievements, Fermin won a competition to have one of his drawings featured on the cover of an art appreciation textbook.

Fermin describes KCC as a place where students can mold their experience to fit their needs.

“You can be as involved or as focused on your studies as you want,” he said. “It’s a great starting point for anyone. Take advantage of all the resources available and enjoy the campus. Reality hits hard once you graduate.”

Fermin turned his passion for art into a fulfilling career, reminding us that with dedication and the right guidance, it’s possible to draw a unique path in life.
