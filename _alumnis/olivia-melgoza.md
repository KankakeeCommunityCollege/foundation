KCC Staff Alumni<br>
Administrative Assistant, TRIO grant programs<br>
’21 KCC Graduate

**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

As I was finishing high school, I wasn’t sure about attending college because of my late father’s illness. My family encouraged me to start at a community college and explore my options. KCC gave me the flexibility to attend classes in a way that worked best for me, which meant a lot since I was also caring for my father at the time. Staying close to family was a priority, and KCC made that possible. It also felt like the right fit and offered everything I was looking for in a college.

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

KCC was a good choice for me because it was close to home and offered the flexibility I needed. While I was studying, I worked as a student employee and cared for my late father during his battle with cancer. I had a lot to balance, but the support and understanding I received from KCC staff made it possible to stay on track and succeed despite the challenges. As an employee, KCC gave me the opportunity to develop new skills while being part of a team that embraces diversity and fosters an inclusive culture.

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

My advice to any student considering KCC is to take advantage of all the resources available to you. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and connect with professors, staff, and fellow students. KCC is a wonderful place to grow, learn, and prepare for your future. Believe in yourself—you have what it takes to succeed, even through the challenges you may face.

**What is your role in your position?**

I am an Administrative Assistant for TRIO (Talent Search, Upward Bound, and Student Support Services). I handle scheduling, recordkeeping, event planning, student outreach, and data entry.

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

The most rewarding part of my job at KCC is knowing I play a role in helping students reach their goals. I value the strong sense of community and the opportunities to build meaningful connections with both students and coworkers.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments the at are most memorable?**

Some of my favorite memories are the team events and going on cultural trips with TRIO Talent Search, Upward Bound, or TRIO SSS. Having been a student in the same program I now work for makes these experiences even more meaningful. I really enjoy connecting with students, coworkers, and the community.
