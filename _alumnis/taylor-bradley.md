Taylor Bradley has always been fascinated with law and politics, with helping others understand their rights. So, it’s no surprise that she graduated KCC with an associate in applied science degree in Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies. But it was far from easy.

“I dropped out of high school at 15 and got my GED after I found out I was pregnant. But my son was my motivator for sure. I felt like I couldn’t make him go to school unless I went back.” Taylor applied to KCC and received the Foundation Scholarship.

“I was really bad at the program at first.” Taylor remembers crying in her advisor’s office. “Dr. Condon told me we were going to get through it together. She asked how I learned best. I’m a very visual learner so she adapted her teaching style to accommodate me.” Taylor’s grades shot up and she branched out in her legal studies, even taking a course that offered unique projects each semester.

“Dr. Kramer and Dr. Condon knew I was bilingual so they assigned me with two other students to the Democrat Commitment project to create self-represented litigant user guides and instruction videos. I used three different translation softwares, the court house interpretive staff, and my own knowledge to translate the guides into Spanish. I tested them on my Spanish-speaking friends and they worked.”

In May, Taylor and her two student partners were awarded the Bernie Ronan Award for Student Action. “The court house didn’t have anything like this before our project so our work is really meeting a need.”

Taylor’s hard work paid off. After graduating, she completed a paid internship at Kankakee County Courthouse. And today, she works as a Paralegal and Office Manager at Alan F. Smietanksi Law Firm in Kankakee, Illinois. “There’s so much more to know. I think I’ll go back and continue taking classes.”

When asked what advice she would give others, Taylor says, “It’s worth the struggle. If I didn’t have my son, if I didn’t have to struggle through classes, I don’t think I’d be where I am today. I’m now very appreciative of everything because I started with nothing. I had to work for it all and the things I learned along the way are priceless.”
