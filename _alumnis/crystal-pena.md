**Crystal Peña: Guiding Futures with Dedication and Vision**

Crystal Peña charted a course to become a speech pathologist after high school. At Kankakee Community College, Crystal worked with her adviser to design a curriculum tailored to her transfer school’s requirements. As a result, she graduated from KCC in 2005 and was ready to start on a bachelor’s degree in communication disorders from Governors State University.

"When they say 'start here, finish anywhere,' they truly mean it,” Crystal said when she reflected on this experience. “KCC ensured my credits transferred and my degree was accepted."

Crystal’s plans took a turn when a colleague encouraged her to explore counseling. Inspired by this suggestion, she found her true calling and earned a master’s degree in school and professional counseling at Olivet Nazarene University.

As the first school counselor at Kankakee Area Career Center, Crystal demonstrated leadership and innovation by spearheading the Career Coaching program, leading the Career Services Department, and overseeing the internship program. She revamped the training curriculum, replacing outdated lectures with dynamic and engaging materials such as videos, slides and step-by-step guides.

"The old methods weren’t resonating with students," Crystal said. "I focused on keeping them engaged and helping them learn effectively."

Some students from the Career Center even became interns with KCC’s Marketing Department.

“I am proud to say I was a part of that,” said Crystal.

When she was at KCC, the diverse environment shaped Crystal’s worldview. She appreciated how KCC offered interaction with people from different cultures, with different perspectives.

"It helped me analyze the world independently and understand others better," she said. "That foundation has been critical in my counseling career."

Crystal credits KCC faculty for making her educational experience unforgettable. One example is a history professor, Dr. James Paul, who brought lessons to life with costumes and interactive debates.

"I hated history because it was always about reading, and I’m not a reader," Crystal said. "But he made it fun and applicable to real life."

Her academic advisor, Jim Grimes, also left a lasting impression.

"He knew how to set students up for success," she said. "That taught me the importance of guiding others accurately and sharing valuable resources."

Her time at KCC also brought personal milestones, including witnessing her now-husband, Rodney, graduate from the nursing program.

"It was amazing to see him succeed," she said.

Now as a counselor at Momence High School, Crystal commits herself to making a difference in her students’ lives. She approaches her work with honesty, empathy and practicality.

"For many students, you might be the only person they open up to," she said. "It’s crucial to address their needs head-on.

"I love helping young people understand that if they want something, it’s possible," she said. "My goal is to prepare them for life beyond school."

Her advice to potential KCC students: “View the campus, get a feel for what it will be like being a student there, find out what financial programs they can offer like the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act Scholarship, and align your studies with your career goals.”

Today, Crystal lives her dream on a daily basis, guiding students through adolescence and early adulthood. Her story exemplifies the power of education, mentorship, and a positive mindset in achieving one’s dreams.
