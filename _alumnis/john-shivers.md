KCC Staff Alumni<br>
Custodian Supervisor, Facilities<br>
’20 KCC Graduate

**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

I started KCC in 1993 just taking classes towards a degree in Criminal Justice, but between working and having a family I was forced to put my education on the back burner. I chose KCC because it was close to home and that’s what I needed after driving back and forth to Joliet every day for work. I don’t think I could have been able to go if KCC wasn’t close to home. 

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

The main reason for choosing KCC was the proximity to home. I also knew that KCC was an excellent community college based on the research I conducted comparing other 2-year organizations in the area. KCC had everything I was looking for right at home.

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

Take advantage of all the federal assistance that’s available, don’t let your financial situation dictate you not getting your degree. Take advantage of the navigators that are here at KCC. They will guide and assist you in making your dream of having a degree and career possible.

**What is your role in your position?**

I am the first shift custodial supervisor. I help keep the facilities clean and make this facility attractive to newcomers who may be considering coming to KCC. I very much believe that first impressions and appearances have a huge effect on someone when they are considering coming to an organization.

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

I think the most rewarding part of the job is getting to know the students and watching them work hard through each semester, but when graduation day comes, I love seeing the joy on their faces after accomplishing their goal.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments that are most memorable?**

Graduation is always special, especially my own during the unknown graduation of 2020 and coming a member of Phi Theta Kappa. I really enjoy the gathering that are held at KCC prior to Christmas break and just getting to know all the employees here that put so much hard work into accomplishing the overall mission of KCC.
