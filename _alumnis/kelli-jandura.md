’03 KCC Graduate

**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

I always knew that I wanted to help people and originally I wanted to be a teacher. I took the CNA  program in high school and found out that I love healthcare. My clinical then led me to the respiratory program at KCC!

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

KCC was the perfect choice for me. It was big enough and had all of the resources I needed to meet my goals, but small enough that it always felt like home.

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

Do it!! You will not regret it. You may start here, but you can finish anywhere!

**What is your role in your position?**

I have loved every minute of my position as the Director of Clinical Education for the Respiratory Program.

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

The most rewarding part is being able to make a difference in patients’ lives through educating future Respiratory Therapists! I get to impact patient care, mentor future professionals, share my knowledge and passion for helping others, witness students’ growth as they progress through the program, and help contribute to advancements in the field.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments that are most memorable?**

I feel honored and privileged to have learned from and work alongside some of the greatest educators. I have many great memories from KCC.
