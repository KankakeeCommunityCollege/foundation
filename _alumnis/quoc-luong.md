**From KCC to Executive Chef: Quoc Luong's Culinary Path**

Quoc Luong's culinary journey began in the kitchen of a nursing home, where he worked alongside his mother.

"I remember looking through food magazines during breaks," Quoc recalls. "Seeing the beautifully-plated dishes sparked something in me—I wanted to create food that people could enjoy."

This early experience, combined with his mother's influence&mdash;she owned a catering and concession business&mdash;planted the seeds for Quoc's future career.

"My mom's cooking was always a big part of my life," he said. "Her dedication and skill in the kitchen definitely inspired me."

Quoc enrolled at KCC in 1984, and took general classes with the intention of transferring to a four-year institution.

"KCC was a great place to start," Quoc said. "The small class sizes and personal attention from professors made it a supportive environment for learning."

After completing a general education transfer degree at KCC in 1986, Quoc moved on to Illinois State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business with a minor in education in 1988.

He worked in the insurance industry for several years. His passion was elsewhere.

"I realized that I had a strong interest in culinary arts," Quoc said, "So, I decided to take cooking classes at the College of DuPage."

Quoc has found his career in the culinary field both rewarding and fulfilling.

"Cooking allows me to create something that I enjoy eating and that others enjoy too,” he said. “It's a wonderful feeling to see people relish the dishes I prepare." His expertise earned him the position of executive chef and partner at Le Colonial in Chicago, where he has worked for 20 years.

Despite his achievements, Quoc never forgot his roots. He chooses to donate to KCC, the place where his education began, over other institutions. "KCC provided me with a solid foundation and a quality education at a fraction of the cost of a four-year university," he said. "I feel a sense of gratitude towards the college, and I believe they can really benefit from my contributions.

"Cooking is about nurturing, just like my mom did for our family. I want to pass that on, whether it's through my dishes or supporting future chefs."

Quoc remains committed to supporting KCC through financial contributions and by encouraging others who are entertaining the idea to attend. "Whether you're just starting out or looking to change careers, KCC is a great place to begin," he said. "It's a bargain for a first-rate education, and it can open doors to so many possibilities."

Quoc's story demonstrates that the journey to a fulfilling career can be full of surprises.

“Education, whether in business or culinary arts, has been instrumental in shaping my career," he said. "I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had and the ability to pursue my passion."
