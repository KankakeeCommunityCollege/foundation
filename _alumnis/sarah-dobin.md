**From pre-law to animal care: Sarah Dobin’s Journey to Veterinary Medicine**

Sarah Dobin’s transition from a pre-law student to a veterinarian exemplifies how unexpected turns can lead to discovering a true passion.

After high school, Sarah chose KCC for its affordability and the chance to explore different fields. She earned an Associate in General Studies degree in 2011. 
 
"I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I graduated high school," she said. "We didn’t have a lot of money, so I got a scholarship to KCC. I loved it. The faculty were incredibly supportive, and I pretty much went for free."
 
At KCC, Sarah was active in Phi Theta Kappa honor society and the TRIO Student Support Services program.
 
"The staff listened to me and encouraged me to explore different paths," she said.
 
After completing an associate degree, she transferred to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to pursue a bachelor’s degree in English Literature. She was considering law school as the next step after finishing a bachelor’s degree. After working for a summer on Mackinac Island in Michigan, she changed her mind.

"I worked closely with a veterinarian, and I just loved it," she shared. "Every day was an adventure—whether we were treating a horse with a minor injury or assisting with a more complex procedure. I realized that I wanted to dedicate my life to helping animals and supporting their families, and that experience was the catalyst for my career change."
 
Sarah began volunteering at a humane society, took additional science courses, and worked as a veterinary assistant. After graduating from the University of Illinois, she completed an internship at a zoo in Seattle, and spent a year as a small animal clinic technician. Those hands-on experiences solidified her passion for veterinary medicine. She applied to the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine.
 
In YEAR, she completed a doctorate in veterinary medicine from the U. of I. Sarah now works at an animal hospital on Merritt Island, Florida, treating everything from household pets to exotic animals like snakes and lizards. She returns twice a year to Mackinac Island to care for the island’s horses.
 
Sarah credits KCC with providing the foundation to explore different paths.
 
"The teachers were encouraging, and programs like TRIO offered the guidance I needed. I learned that it’s okay to try different things and even fail—that lesson has stayed with me throughout my career."
 
For Sarah, her time at KCC was not only about academics; it was also where she met her husband.
 
"We were in the same scholarship program and started hanging out between classes with a group of friends," she said. "We are all still close to this day, and my sister even met her husband at KCC, too!
 
"KCC was the perfect place for me to start. It gave me the time and space to figure out what I truly wanted to do, along with the education and support I needed to get there. I would recommend it to anyone unsure of their path or looking for an affordable way to begin their education."
