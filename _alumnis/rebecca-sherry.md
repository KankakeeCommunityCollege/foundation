KCC Staff Alumni<br>
Radiography Program Director<br>
â€™06 KCC Graduate

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

I originally went to a university and realized that the large lecture halls were not for me. I learn best when I can ask questions and have a more intimate class size. I went to KCC for Radiography, and it was an excellent choice. In 2 years at KCC, I received the education needed for me to have a fulfilling career in healthcare!

**How well did KCC prepare you for your current job?**

I feel KCC did an amazing job preparing me for my job. It gave me the skills needed to be a radiologic technologist. As program director of the very same program, I graduated from, I believe it demonstrates the success of the KCC radiography program.

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

I would recommend all students to attend KCC before making the choice to go to a university. KCC provides great transfer general education courses, which helps keep costs low. During their time at KCC they can explore the various programs we offer. KCC offers something for everyone.

**Add in anything else about KCC that you think new or prospective students should know.**

I would tell prospective students that it would benefit them to come to campus and check out the programs offered. I wish I had done that before going to a university. I changed my major many times and could have saved a lot of money and started my career sooner. KCC is a great place to start your educational journey. It could even be a fantastic place to end it with one of our many excellent programs!
