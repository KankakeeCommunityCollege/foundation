**Mia Arseneau earned a college degree Before High School Graduation**

Mia Arseneau's academic journey took an unconventional route, including being homeschooled until seventh grade. She transitioned to the Kankakee School District, then experienced several years affected by COVID-19. As a high school junior, she enrolled in Kankakee Community College’s Early College program. 

"Starting at KCC was a turning point for me," Mia recalls. "It was my first experience with a full in-person academic year, and it allowed me to explore my interests and find a community where I truly felt I belonged."

Mia chose the Early College Program for a more challenging and fulfilling educational experience. Her father, Jesse, also attended KCC. She said his positive experience also played a key role in her decision.

In Early College, students take classes at KCC instead of their high school during their junior and/or senior year. They still participate in high school activities, including sports and band. Each high school determines eligibility for its students. Some Early College students, like Mia, who take part for two years, receive an associate degree a few weeks or so before their official high school graduation.

"The Early College Program is a valuable opportunity for juniors and seniors to prepare for and ease their transition to college," said Laura Ryan, assistant director of enrollment services and the Early College Program Advisor for KCC.

“Students have access to individualized advising, academic and support services, and as Mia discovered, an environment that supports yet challenges them in pursuit of their educational goals, including earning a degree before their high school diploma. It’s an honor to be a part of students’ journeys, and we look forward to the program’s continued success." 

At KCC, Mia overcame social anxiety and formed connections with peers and faculty. She found a supportive and inclusive environment at KCC's Center for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, where she participated in discussions and activities that broadened her perspective.

"The EDI Center was a welcoming space where I could engage in meaningful conversations and meet people from diverse backgrounds," Mia said. "It helped me grow as a person and become more comfortable in social situations."

Mia also appreciated the support of KCC faculty, including her English professor, Amy Porter.

"Amy Porter was incredible," Mia shared. “She made the classroom a space where I felt comfortable asking questions and seeking extra help. Her classes were engaging, and the discussions were always thought-provoking."

At KCC, Mia discovered a passion for art. She participated in several art shows, and one of her charcoal drawings caught the attention of the department's dean, who purchased the piece. This experience boosted her confidence and affirmed her creative talents.

For Fall 2024, Mia transferred to Illinois State University in Normal to study theater, film, and digital media with a focus on animation.

"KCC was more than just a stepping stone; it was a place where I found my voice and gained the skills I need for my future studies," she said. "If you're thinking about attending KCC, go for it. The community is supportive, and the education you receive will set you up for success. It’s an experience that can truly shape your future."
