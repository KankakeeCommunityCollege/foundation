**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

I have always wanted to further my education, and choosing KCC was the perfect fit for my life circumstances. As a local institution, KCC made it possible for me to begin my educational journey while balancing full-time employment and raising my young daughters.

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

KCC was an excellent choice for me as an employee, as it allowed me to advance my career by earning my associate degree in Heating and Air Conditioning while remaining employed. The flexible scheduling at KCC made it possible to attend classes while managing both work and family commitments.

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

My advice for students considering KCC is that it offers courses that can accommodate your schedule and align with your desired career path. Additionally, KCC provides courses that are transferable to other Universities. Why not start your educational journey at KCC; and have the flexibility to finish your degree elsewhere when desired.

**What is your role in your position?**

I am responsible for ensuring that the maintenance department operates smoothly and efficiently.

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

The opportunity to grow professionally and academically.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments the at are most memorable?**

One of the most memorable events was seeing all four of my daughters and my spouse walk the stage to proudly receive their KCC degrees.
