**A Journey of Discovery: Mary Bass’ Path at KCC**

Although Mary Bass knew she wanted to make the most of her education, she didn’t have much career guidance when she first considered college.

“In my late teens, most women I knew were becoming nurses, stay-at-home moms, or working in offices,” Mary said. “While nursing is such a noble profession, I get queasy at the sight of blood, so I knew that wasn’t the path for me.”

Though she didn’t feel business-minded either, Mary’s love for learning and creativity pointed her in a different direction. Having been homeschooled, she’d always enjoyed exploring new subjects but wasn’t quite sure where her passion lied. Crafty and artistic by nature, Mary decided to pursue art classes while completing her General Education requirements at Kankakee Community College.

“I loved fashion and spent a lot of time drawing,” she said. “So I figured I’d take some art classes and see if fashion design at Columbia University or the School of the Art Institute of Chicago was for me.”

KCC was the perfect choice for Mary—it was affordable, close to home, and gave her the flexibility to explore different interests.

“I was able to pay for a lot of college myself, with some help from my parents,” she said. “I’m so glad I did my associate’s degree there because it gave me the time to figure out what I wanted to pursue for my bachelor’s degree without wasting a lot of money.”

In the process, Mary discovered her love for creating art. Her professors, including Chelise Slowik, Jean Janssen, and Michael Constanza, had a lasting impact on her. Figure drawing and painting classes became favorites.

"The professors were amazing and helped me realize I had a talent for art that I hadn’t fully tapped into," said Mary.

“Mary was one of those students you never forget,” said Slowik, KCC art professor. “She was a joy to be around, and it was exciting to watch her grow, both creatively and professionally.”

Another pivotal experience was taking a speech class with Tinker Parker.

“It was one of the hardest classes I’ve ever taken,” Mary admits, “but also one of the most valuable. I remember shaking during my speeches, but the practice was worth it. I still use the skills I learned in that class today.”

After a brief break, Mary transferred to Olivet Nazarene University, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in art. Thanks to the solid foundation she built at KCC, the transition was smooth.

“I didn’t have any trouble transitioning to higher-level classes because KCC gave me such a great start,” Mary said. “I even graduated with honors from both KCC and Olivet.”

Today, Mary has been working at the Kankakee Public Library for 12 years. She started as a youth services assistant and now serves as a supervisor.

“I use my education every day in unexpected ways,” she said. “I write a lot, create flyers, and handle communications. I also give speeches and work with diverse groups of people, so the psychology and sociology I learned at KCC are skills I draw on regularly.”

Mary’s life took many turns she hadn’t expected, but she’s content with where she ended up.

“KCC took me on an unexpected journey, and I discovered passions I didn’t know I had. I’m grateful for that.”

According to Mary, one of the greatest benefits of attending KCC was affordability.

“I only have a small student loan from undergrad because I was able to get scholarships to complete my degree,” she said. "You get out of a degree what you put into it. Even in classes that didn’t seem directly aligned with my goals, I still learned valuable skills.”

Mary also emphasized the importance of making connections and using available resources.

“There are so many tutoring services and fellow students who are willing to help. Don’t be afraid to ask for guidance. I’m still in touch with some of my professors and classmates today.”

For Mary Bass, KCC was more than just a stepping stone—it was where she discovered her true passions and built a foundation that would carry her through life.
