**From CNA to NP: Cristian Salazar’s Practical Path in Nursing**

When Cristian Salazar began working at Riverside Medical Center as a certified nursing assistant, he focused on understanding the demands of patient care. A decade later, he now serves patients in the same hospital as a neurology nurse practitioner.

Cristian enrolled at Kankakee Community College in the fall of 2015, completing general studies courses and a CNA certification. He continued taking classes and earned an Associate Degree in Nursing in December 2019.

“Some of my most memorable experiences were the times I spent between classes meeting other like-minded individuals,” he said. “Seeing others work through their own struggles helped push me to stay determined.”

Faculty played a key role in shaping how Cristian approached learning and problem-solving. Ken West’s philosophy courses challenged him to think more critically and expansively about life and decision-making.

“(Ken) West helped me think outside of the box and look at things from different perspectives,” Cristian said.

In the sciences, Bob Ling’s microbiology courses stood out for their rigor and engagement.

“You could see Professor Ling’s continued enjoyment and passion for the subject,” Cristian said.

Cristian described KCC’s campus culture as grounded and reflective of real life.

“The students at KCC range in age, home life, economic status, and lifestyle,” he said. “It feels much closer to everyday life and what comes after college.”

Hands-on learning formed the foundation of his nursing education. Through clinical rotations and simulation days, Cristian translated theory into practice, developing the critical thinking skills required in healthcare settings.

“Those experiences helped me critically apply what we learned in real situations,” he said. “That practical side has been the most useful for me.”

Throughout the nursing program, faculty emphasized compassion, knowledge, and a strong work ethic. Those principles became central to how Cristian approached patient care and professional responsibility.

Earning an associate degree represented Cristian’s first formal step into the nursing profession and confirmed that his long-term goals were within reach.

Cristian continued his education while working full-time at Riverside Medical Center. He earned a  bachelor’s degree in nursing from Capella University in 2022 and a master’s degree in nursing from Northern Kentucky University in May 2025, specializing as a family nurse practitioner.

Looking back, Cristian expressed confidence in the preparation he received at KCC.

“The quality of education was more than sufficient, and sometimes more advanced than what peers experienced elsewhere,” he said. “I never felt unprepared.”

Today, Cristian lives in his hometown of Momence, and serves the community through his work in neurology. He credits KCC with laying the foundation for both his professional growth and long-term stability.

“KCC helped me with education, hands-on experience, motivation, and financial stability,” he said. “I don’t think I would be the same person without that experience.”

For those considering KCC, Cristian said “Come motivated. Stay motivated. If you’re determined to learn, no profession is out of reach.”
