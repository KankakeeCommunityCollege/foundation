In the Deany household in Chebanse, college wasn't a common topic of conversation. Dennis Deany and his siblings changed that, and became the first generation in their family to pursue higher education.

After high school, Dennis explored career paths at Kankakee Community College. Reflecting on his pivotal decision, Dennis recalls, "I chose KCC because of its affordability, proximity to home, and the flexibility in class schedules it offered."

While juggling full-time work and studies, Dennis earned an associate degree in general studies from KCC in 2001. Dennis continued at Governors State University, and earned a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies with a minor in communications in 2013. He then completed a master's degree in vocational rehabilitation from Northeastern Illinois University in 2020.

Dennis also has had a 34-year career with the state of Illinois. Currently, he is a program specialist for the Illinois Council on Developmental Disabilities.

“We invest in innovative projects to make the lives of people with developmental disabilities in Illinois better,” Dennis explained.

KCC was pivotal. “It was the foundation and the experience of being at KCC that helped propel me to go on to finish my bachelor's degree and then pursue my master's degree,” Dennis said.

“The faculty and staff at KCC were beyond exceptional every step of the way,” he noted. “Whether it was helping with the registration process, picking out my course schedule, or getting me through my classes, everyone was very supportive along the way. Everyone wanted me to succeed. I rate my education at KCC at an exceptional 11 on a scale of 10.

When asked about challenges while at KCC, Dennis said, “I think my biggest challenge was myself at that point in my life.” By overcoming self-imposed barriers, Dennis said he learned the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving academic success.

"If you're contemplating attending KCC, take the leap,” he advised. “If you plan to start in the fall, consider enrolling in a summer class and see if it resonates with you. Don't hesitate to try. Have confidence in yourself. Establish a goal and steadily work towards it. With determination and perseverance, you'll eventually reach your goal.

"Education is personal—what suits one may not suit another,” Dennis continued. “There's no fixed timeline. Go at your own pace. Whether it's one class a semester or a full load, do what’s best for you. Avoid comparisons and concentrate on your own unique path."
