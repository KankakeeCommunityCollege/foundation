**Leah Love: A Lifelong Learner and Advocate for Growth**

Leah Love’s story is a testament to her unwavering dedication, tireless work ethic, and passion for making a difference. 

Drawing on her diverse career experiences&mdash;from childcare and hospitality management to healthcare and fitness&mdash;Leah dreams of combining her skills to design innovative programs that inspire movement, creativity, and holistic growth for children.

Her connection to Kankakee Community College began during high school. She was introduced to college-level coursework through the Upward Bound program, which helped provide a  seamless transition into higher education.

"The program gave me a head start," Leah said. "By the time I graduated high school, I was already taking college courses and working in child development. KCC provided a solid foundation that prepared me for success."

At KCC, Leah immersed herself in the Child Development program, gaining hands-on experience that immediately translated into job opportunities.  Both before and after her time at KCC, she was teaching children ages 2 to 5 in the Kankakee and Chicago areas.

"The (KCC) instructors were amazing," she recalls. "Before I even graduated, I was working with Head Start programs and preschools in the Kankakee area. Those early experiences shaped who I am today."

Leah earned her associate degree in Child Development (now called Early Childhood Education) from KCC in 2005. Four years later, Leah earned a bachelor’s degree in hospitality management from Grambling State University, leading to a five-year career in hotel management.

In 2019, she expanded her expertise by taking on a role as a phlebotomist. For three years, she worked at Saint Mary’s Hospital in Kankakee before relocating to Houston, Texas.

Leah’s passion for fitness also became a central part of her life. She became a certified Zumba instructor and group fitness coach, teaching classes at LA Fitness and Crunch Fitness in Houston. This role allowed her to blend her love for health and community engagement with her natural ability to inspire others.

"The (KCC) faculty and staff gave me the tools I needed to succeed," Leah said. "They provided tutoring, financial aid guidance, and encouragement. Even today, the skills I learned in the child development program apply to everything I do."

Leah encourages others to consider KCC as a stepping stone for their own success.

"It’s affordable, accessible, and provides a strong foundation," she said. "No matter where life takes you, the lessons you learn here will stay with you forever."

Now, Leah is focused on her dream of establishing a business that introduces children to the joys of movement and creativity. She envisions enrichment and creative fitness programs tailored to the needs of daycare locations, as well as opening an indoor playground—a vibrant space where children can learn, play, and grow under the guidance of a dedicated childcare professional.
