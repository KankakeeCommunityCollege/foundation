**Rooted in Purpose: Rachel Bohl Lutowsky’s Journey from KCC to Coaching Leaders**

Rachel Bohl Lutowsky grew up on her family’s farm in Grant Park. Hard work and responsibility were part of everyday life.

After high school, she enrolled at KCC to pursue a career as a teacher, initially focusing on early childhood education. After a year of classes, Rachel discovered a stronger interest in communication and business and she changed majors. It took some extra time to complete her associate degree.

“It didn’t go exactly as planned, and that’s okay,” said Rachel. “People put pressure on themselves to have it all figured out, but sometimes it’s in the detours that we discover what we’re really meant to do.”

After graduating from KCC in 1994, Rachel earned a bachelor’s degree in organizational leadership from DePaul University while working full-time.

“I was juggling a lot, but my time at KCC helped prepare me for that,” she said. “I learned to manage multiple responsibilities and adapt quickly. That foundation made a big difference.”

Rachel especially valued the quality of the instructors during her time at KCC.

“Many of my professors were working full-time in their fields, not just teaching from textbooks,” she said. “That real-world experience brought so much value to the classroom. I felt like I was getting a high-quality education without the big price tag.”

Rachel served on the Student Advisory Council, where she helped shape student programming and engaged with campus leadership. She earned induction into Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society for community college students. During that same period, she also held the title of Miss Kankakee County and appeared on the cover of the KCC course catalog.

“I wore a lot of hats,” said Rachel. “It was a busy time, but it was also empowering. I was learning how to use my voice.”

One class in particular sparked a deeper interest in psychology.

“My Intro to Psychology teacher had such a great sense of humor and made the subject come alive,” she said. “That class planted the seed for me to minor in psychology later at DePaul.”

After earning her bachelor’s degree, Rachel began her career as a corporate trainer.

“I thought I’d be teaching children, but I ended up teaching adults in corporate settings,” she said. “It was the perfect blend of my interests in education, communication, and business.”

By her mid-20s, she moved into leadership roles in learning and development departments.

In 2006, Rachel and her husband relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, and launched Dynamic Leadership Solutions LLC, a consulting and coaching firm. Since then, Rachel has guided small and midsize businesses across the country, helping leaders grow and organizations thrive.

“I love what I do,” she said. “Coaching executives and teams is all about helping people reach their potential, and that’s incredibly rewarding.”

Rachel credits KCC with helping her build the professional and interpersonal skills she still uses every day.

“I developed strong communication skills, both verbal and written,” Rachel recalls. “I also learned how to be professional, how to work with different kinds of people, and how to adapt. These are the same skills I now coach others to strengthen in their own careers.”

She also appreciates the diversity of the KCC community.

“I was surrounded by students from all walks of life—some were older, some right out of high school. That mix brought a richness to the classroom discussions. It was a very inclusive and welcoming environment.”

For students considering their next step, Rachel advises: “Just start. You don’t have to know exactly where you’re going. KCC gives you room to explore your interests, shift directions, and still come out ahead. It was the ideal launching pad for everything I’ve done since.”
