<h4 class="blue-heading-small">What was your favorite memory of KCC?</h4>

My favorite memory was the independence that I had on the campus while still being able to live at home. I remember going to classes throughout the day. Then I enjoyed working out at the fitness center, hanging out in the cafeteria with classmates, or studying independently in the library in between classes. The best part about KCC was that it allowed me to stay at home while getting a quality educationâ€”taking the general education classes I needed for college while paying an affordable price. I also liked the fact that I was able to attend with many of my classmates from my high school (Kankakee High School). There was a large number of students from other local high schools that attended KCC that I was able to meet, bond with, and become good friends with as well.

KCC gave me a love for education. I went on to finish my college education at Olivet Nazarene University where I initially earned a bachelor's degree in dietetics. After working in the public health sector in nutrition, I realized that I loved learning new things and teaching them to others. I then went on to earn a master's degree in education at Olivet and this is my 12th year teaching in Kankakee School District. I appreciate my experiences at KCC and share them with my students so that they understand KCC is a quality and affordable option to begin their college career while they are still trying to figure out what they want to go to college for.
