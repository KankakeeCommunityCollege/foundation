Dr. Moira Martin, a chiropractor, attributes much of her career's foundation to Kankakee Community College.

Raised in the Manteno area, Martin started college with general education classes at KCC, earning an Associate of Arts transfer degree in 2012. She transferred to Saint Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin, and obtained a bachelor’s degree in integrated human health sciences. Next, Martin completed a Doctor of Chiropractic degree at Logan University near St. Louis.

Several factors influenced Martin's decision to attend KCC. Two of them were her father 's positive experience as a board member, and her sister attending KCC. The decisive factor was that KCC provided the ideal environment for exploring various subjects.

"One of the key reasons I chose KCC was the welcoming atmosphere and the freedom to explore different fields,” Martin reflected. “I wasn't sure about my career path, and KCC gave me the space to discover my passion."

The impact of a specific class at KCC—Career Exploration with Emily Skelly—was profound. This one-credit-hour class guided students to understand their values, preferences, and career priorities. It required students to interview or shadow professionals in potential fields, which significantly influenced Martin's career choice.

"I can't overstate the impact of the Career Exploration class,” Martin said. “It went beyond just discussing careers; it pushed us to dig deep and understand what truly resonated with us."

Fondly recalling unique experiences at KCC, such as her father presenting her diploma during graduation, Martin highlights KCC's emphasis on community and relationships. She also appreciates the KCC job fairs for offering valuable insights into many different opportunities.

"KCC wasn't just about classes; it was about building connections,” she shared. “The personal touch, like my father handing me the diploma, is something I cherish. It symbolizes the community spirit at KCC."

The faculty and staff at KCC played an instrumental role in Martin's journey. Supportive English teachers like Amy Porter accommodated individual student needs, and professors like Scott Lemenager extended invitations to students without Thanksgiving plans, showcasing genuine concern for their well-being. Dr. Martin emphasizes the level of trust and personal attention KCC faculty and staff provided, fostering a supportive learning environment.

"The support I received from the faculty at KCC was unparalleled. They went the extra mile, creating an environment where I felt valued and encouraged to overcome challenges," Dr. Martin states.

Facing challenges in classes like speech, statistics, and physics at KCC, Dr. Martin turned
adversity into growth. The supportive atmosphere, coupled with teachers' willingness to assist beyond regular hours, propelled her past academic obstacles. Her commitment to her studies earned her a place on the President's List for exceptional academic achievement. As a member of Phi Theta Kappa at KCC, she accompanied her peers on a trip to Seattle, creating connections with honor students from across the nation.

She rates the overall quality of education at KCC very highly, emphasizing that the
coursework at KCC prepared her exceptionally well for upper-level classes at her subsequent institutions. She advises future students to visit KCC, interact with peers, and explore available resources thoroughly.

Dr. Moira Martin's journey from KCC to a successful chiropractic career exemplifies the profound impact of community college education. KCC is not merely a starting point; it’s the foundation for future success.
