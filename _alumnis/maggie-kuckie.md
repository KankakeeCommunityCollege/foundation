Maggie Kuckie, owner of Spa Remedy in Bradley, Illinois, credits the start of her path to success to her time at Kankakee Community College. In business since 2014 with her husband, Jim, the spa is a testament to her belief in proactive wellness and the body’s ability to heal itself. The couple are driven by the desire to keep their community&nbsp;healthy.

**Educational Beginnings**<br>
Maggie’s roots are deep in the community. She attended St. Joseph's Catholic School in Bradley and Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School. As a teenager, her love for science and math drew her to the healthcare field. Wanting to stay close to her family and unsure of her exact path, she chose to start her education at KCC and completed her General Studies degree in 2004. Now as a successful business owner, Maggie fondly mentions KCC’s “Start Here. Finish Anywhere.” motto as a mantra for her&nbsp;life. 
 
“Give yourself the opportunity to change your mind,” Maggie would advise prospective students. “Even when you think you've figured it all out, life has a way of surprising you. The transition from being 17 to 21 years old is a time of immense change and self-discovery. It can set you on an entirely new path from what you initially envisioned. That's why I strongly advocate for considering KCC after high school. It grants you the chance to try different courses, explore various interests, and gives you room to grow and change without the heavy costs or time commitment that can come with a four-year&nbsp;college.”
 
**Family Influence and Shaping Experiences**<br>
Maggie cherishes memories of accompanying her dad to night classes at KCC. She was fortunate to witness his determination firsthand. “It's like I got a sneak peek into the college experience even before my own journey began,” Maggie said. “The connection is really&nbsp;special.” 
 
Looking back, she realizes her time at KCC shaped her in profound ways. It taught her self-reliance, the importance of hands-on learning, and the value of community support. The Certified Nursing Assistant course stands out as a pivotal experience that honed her practical skills and ignited her passion for&nbsp;healthcare.
 
"It was invaluable to have teachers who were actively working in the field we were studying,” Maggie said. “This brought a unique perspective, beyond traditional teaching, and provided real-life insights based on their&nbsp;experiences."
 
**Building a Diverse Skill Set**<br>
Diligent and ambitious, Maggie juggled three jobs while in college, beginning as a receptionist at a nursing home and later as a rehab tech. Her exposure to physical and occupational therapy sparked her interest in massage therapy, leading her to pursue formal training in Chicago. While pursuing her nursing degree at Olivet Nazarene University, she worked as a surgical tech at Riverside Medical Center and later obtained her bachelor of science in nursing degree from the university in&nbsp;2010.
 
**The Bridge to Higher Education**<br>
KCC provided Maggie a bridge from high school to the university environment, allowing her to mature and discover her true calling. “I've had friends who go away to school and then they end up coming back and going to KCC for something different because they changed their mind,” said Maggie. “KCC provides the perfect transition from high school to the college&nbsp;environment.”
 
**A Call to Aspiring Students**<br>
To any aspiring students, she wholeheartedly recommends KCC, “It's a place where you can grow, learn, and build a foundation for a bright future,” Maggie said. “Take advantage of the opportunities, immerse yourself in hands-on experiences, and trust that your journey will shape you in ways you never&nbsp;imagined.”
