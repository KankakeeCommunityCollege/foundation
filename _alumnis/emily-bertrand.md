**Alumni Spotlight: A Journey of Growth and Teaching Excellence**

Learning has always been Emily Bertrand’s passion.

&ldquo;Making a daily impact on students is something that holds great significance for me,&rdquo; Emily said. She is currently a technology teacher at Liberty Intermediate School in Bourbonnais. &ldquo;I just love learning, so I want to make sure that my students love learning, too.&rdquo;

The decision to stay in her community allowed her to work, attend KCC and maintain a close connection to her hometown.

"KCC was a great way to start my continuing education,&rdquo; Emily shared. &ldquo;It introduced me to how higher-level education was structured, easing the transition from high school to college."

Emily has 16 years of teaching experience, and currently teaches technology to fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. She is dedicated to incorporating STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) principles into her classes. This is a continuation of Emily’s academic foundation, which includes a STEM-focused master’s degree from the Erikson Institute in Chicago.

Reflecting on her time at KCC, Emily acknowledges the positive community, engaging faculty, and the support she received. Real-world experiences, such as visiting a funeral home during a "Death and Dying" class and exploring drug court proceedings in an American government class, enriched her education and broadened her perspective.

Born and raised in Kankakee, Emily completed a General Studies degree at KCC in 2003. She also has a bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Governors State University in University Park and a STEM-focused master's degree from the Erikson Institute in Chicago.

As she faced challenges such as time management, Emily turned them into opportunities for personal growth. She also balanced work, a social life and coursework at KCC.

&ldquo;KCC played a vital role in guiding my transition from high school to college,&rdquo; Emily noted. &ldquo;It instilled in me a sense of independence. I learned to navigate diverse class timings on different days and adopt a more flexible approach to completing assignments.&rdquo;

Some things Emily said prospective students should think about are exploring a variety of classes, seeking guidance from advisors, and embracing the chance to discover their passion.
