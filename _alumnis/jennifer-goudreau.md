**From Classroom to Courtroom: Jennifer Goudreau's Path from KCC to Assistant State's Attorney**

Growing up, Jennifer Goudreau always felt a pull toward public service. Kankakee Community College later became a solid base for Jennifer’s educational and professional advancements.

"I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do with my career, but I knew I wanted to go to graduate school eventually," Jennifer said. "KCC was a great way to save money and stay close to my family while I figured things out."

Jennifer completed a KCC transfer degree with a concentration in political science. She transferred to Governors State University, and earned a bachelor’s degree in social work. She further honed her skills with a master’s degree in social work from Loyola University and a law degree from Southern Illinois University.

Jennifer said this unique combination of social work and legal knowledge allowed her to approach justice with a deep empathy for her clients and a strong command of legal principles.

Jennifer's career began as a public defender in Winnebago County. "Being a public defender allowed me to connect with clients during some of their most difficult times," she said. "That experience solidified my passion for justice and compassion within the legal system."

Returning to her roots, Jennifer now serves as an assistant state's attorney in Kankakee County. She credits KCC with providing a solid foundation for her career.

"Unlike at big universities where teaching assistants often lead classes, KCC's smaller class sizes ensure that instructors who write the syllabus are the ones actually teaching the course and know their students," she said. “The faculty were incredibly supportive. They challenged me in the classroom and helped me discover my strengths.”

KCC also nurtured Jennifer’s commitment to community service.

“The support I received at KCC was instrumental in shaping who I am today," she said. "The college not only offered affordable education, but also fostered a sense of community involvement."

Receiving a Rotaract Club scholarship gave Jennifer a deeper understanding of community needs and instilled a sense of responsibility to give back. Through this program, she participated in projects like river clean-ups and fundraising for local charities.

"I would absolutely recommend KCC to anyone starting their academic journey,” she said. “It's a place where you can gain valuable knowledge, develop strong connections, and make a positive impact in your community. KCC not only offered affordability, but also provided a high-quality education that rivaled any larger university."
