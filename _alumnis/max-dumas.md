**Max Dumas: From Student to Instructor, Welding His Way to Success**

Max Dumas has been working with his hands for as long as he can remember. By the time he was 3, he was already in the garage with his dad, helping build hot rods and custom cars. That early introduction to craftsmanship became a lifelong passion.

In high school, Max began taking evening and weekend welding classes at KCC.

"I chose KCC because I kept hearing how great the welding program was," Max said. "It just made sense to get started while I was still in high school."

At KCC, Max passed several rigorous welding tests—milestones that felt both challenging and deeply rewarding, he said. He started working in the field while still at KCC, thanks to guidance from faculty and support from local professionals. One of those professionals was Mark Stevenson, a retired KCC welding professor who also owned Stevenson Fabrication in Manteno until 2024.

"Getting that job at Stevenson Fabrication while still in the welding program was huge," Max said. "It felt like everything I was learning had a purpose right away."

"Max had a natural talent, a great attitude, and the kind of personality you want in the trades," Stevenson said. "He stood out early, mastered the skills, and later became one of the youngest adjunct faculty members in the welding program. His success inspired others as well. His high school friends saw how well he was doing and followed his lead. That is the kind of growth we love to see at KCC."

Max also recalls the camaraderie in the welding lab and the pride that came from pushing through tough projects alongside his peers.

"We had a lot of good times in the lab," he said. "There was a real sense of teamwork."

In all, Max completed 11 KCC classes in welding and machine tool, with A's in all of them.

The support from faculty and staff left a lasting impact. Max credits his instructors for helping him grow both personally and professionally—and today, he works alongside many of them as a colleague.

"I never had a bad professor," Max said. "The support was very, very good and now I get to work with the same people who once taught me. It's pretty wild."

He speaks highly of Roger Koerner, a full-time professor at KCC's Manufacturing & Industrial Technology Center; Tim Marcotte, the KCC Welding professor who also taught machine tool courses; and Tyson Creek, a peer from his time at KCC, who now owns Stevenson Fabrication and who also teaches part-time at KCC.

"I remember when Max and his father, Mike Dumas, together were enrolled in my machine tool classes," Koerner said. "It struck me as a great way for a father and son to spend time together. Max demonstrated a passion for learning and quickly showed this in how he aspired for excellence. Max has demonstrated his extensive talent in welding, machine tool and fabrication. It says quite a lot when your student becomes a member of the faculty."

Today, at 24, Max is a part-time welding faculty member at KCC. Outside the classroom, he builds custom cars from scratch alongside his father at their shop, Platinum Custom Cars in Manteno.

His advice for anyone considering KCC is "Don't wait. Just go for it. If you're willing to put in the work, KCC gives you everything you need to succeed at any age. Students can start as early as 16 years old."

For Max, KCC wasn't just a school—it was the place where his passion turned into a profession. Now, he's paying it forward by helping others find that same sense of purpose and pride.
