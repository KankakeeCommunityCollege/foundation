**What was the path that led you to KCC?**
{: .mb-1}

I joined the Navy directly after graduating from Kankakee High School in 2010. I had a very active military career requiring me to move multiple times. I was stationed in numerous locations across the US and in Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan. In Japan, I met my husband Cesar Salgado, who was also in the US Navy. We were engaged after a few months and had two children by July of 2015 Just a few months after Cesar was honorably discharged, we learned he had kidney cancer at the age of 25. Now cancer free we continue to closely monitor his health. I moved to the active reserves as a Navy corpsman in 2016. Returning to Illinois in 2017 after full-time military life posed some challenges, but I was determined to meet them head on. I began working on the prerequisites for the Respiratory Therapist program at KCC. My husband also attended KCC at that time. I completed my associate in applied sciences with honors in the fall of 2019, just weeks after giving birth to my third child.

**Was KCC a good choice for you?**

KCC was a wonderful choice for me. While I had the GI bill and did not need to worry about the financial side, the added services KCC provided me were very helpful. The veteran’s assistance team at KCC is amazing. They made the process of using my VA benefit easy. After six years on active duty, going back to college is like starting all over again and they made the process as easy as possible as I transitioned into civilian life. 

**Has your KCC degree helped you achieve your career goals?**

Once I received my degree, after two short years, I had a job lined up prior to graduation, pending my board exam. As a respiratory therapist, I was able to start out in the medical field making a very livable wage with room for growth. This allowed me to work through a global pandemic and a hurricane while so many other fields were laid off. I served on the “Hurricane Team A,” at Gulf Coast Medical Center in Fort Myers during Hurricane Ian in September of 2022. The hurricane displaced my family for nearly a week, but I was able to continue to serve on the response team and aid my community. This is a very rewarding career with excellent opportunities and job security.

My community college education has made me who I am today. It was a great way to get started in a fantastic field that has provided me growth and opportunity.
