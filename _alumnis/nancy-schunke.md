**How did you decide KCC was right for you?**

Choosing KCC was the right decision for me due to its affordability, high-quality education, and flexibility. With lower tuition rates, I avoided substantial debt. The knowledgeable professors, smaller class sizes, and personalized attention significantly enhanced my learning experience. Flexible scheduling allowed me to balance studies with work and other responsibilities. Additionally, KCC’s transfer agreements with four-year universities made it easier to continue my education. 

**Why was KCC a good choice for you?**

KCC was a good choice for me as a first-generation college student because it provided a supportive and familiar environment close to home. Being close to home for my first two years made the transition into college easier. The smaller campus and class sizes allowed for more personalized attention from instructors, making it easier to seek help and build relationships. 

**What advice would you give a student considering KCC?**

If you're considering KCC, my advice is to fully embrace this option as a smart, strategic step in your educational journey. Community colleges offer high-quality education at a fraction of the cost of four-year universities, allowing you to complete general education requirements without accruing significant debt. Take advantage of the smaller class sizes to build strong relationships with your professors and get personalized support.

**What is your role in your position?**

As Director for the KCC South Extension Center, I am responsible for the management and operations for the South Extension Center including supervision of staff, programs, services, outreach, enrollment tracking and academic advising. Additionally, I manage marketing and advancement functions with focus on alumni, outreach, recruitment, and project management. 

**What is the most rewarding part of your job?**

The most rewarding part of my job is providing opportunities and programming for college students at the South Extension Center in Watseka and watching them develop into confident, capable individuals. Seeing students who may have initially been uncertain or hesitant transform into engaged and self-assured learners is incredibly fulfilling. I take great pride in knowing that the programs and support we offer are making a tangible difference in their lives, helping them achieve their academic goals and inspiring them to reach their full potential.

**During your time working at KCC, what are some of the events or moments that are most memorable?**

One of the most memorable experiences for me was collaborating with a team of colleagues to develop the Fast Path transfer degree program. This program is significant as it marks the first time an entire degree can be earned entirely at the South Extension Center in Watseka. Witnessing our first cohort of students earn their degrees in 2020 was an incredibly rewarding and unforgettable moment, highlighting the impact of our collective efforts and dedication.
