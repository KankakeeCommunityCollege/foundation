**Liz's Journey: From KCC to a Successful Career in Merchandising**

In high school, Liz Lutz earned straight A's, and was offered a full academic scholarship to KCC. Liz then attended KCC and three other colleges on her path of academic exploration and self-discovery.

"Going to community college is really important," Liz said. "A lot of people think they need to go straight to a four-year university, but KCC allowed me to get my associate's degree practically free of charge. That financial freedom gave me the flexibility to explore different career paths without the burden of extra debt."

After earning her associate degree in 2008, Liz transferred to the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs to pursue a biology degree with dreams of becoming a veterinarian. In pre-vet courses, she realized her deep love for animals made the profession too emotionally challenging.

"I knew I had to rethink my career path," she said. "I loved math and science but hated writing. I needed something analytical but creative."

Liz chose fashion merchandising at Northern Illinois University as her next step. She moved back to Illinois, took a semester off to regain residency, and enrolled. At NIU she also reconnected with Steve, a KCC classmate who later became her husband.

When Steve's family moved to Macomb, Liz followed, then finished her bachelor's degree at Western Illinois University in 2013. Though her college journey took seven years, she remained determined.

"A degree isn't about how fast you finish—it's about where it takes you," she said.

One month after graduating, Liz launched her career in the executive training program of Von Maur, an upscale department store chain. Starting in store management in Bloomington, Illinois and Alpharetta, Georgia, she developed a passion for the corporate side of the business. Liz transitioned to the company's headquarters in Davenport, Iowa, where she went from buyer to senior buyer, then divisional merchandising manager of boys and infants.

"I wouldn't be where I am today without KCC," she said. "It gave me a strong foundation, saved me money, and opened up opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise."

Liz also fondly remembers the friendships she built at KCC, the engaging professors who challenged her, and the extracurricular activities that helped her grow. She participated in Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE), attended competitions in Chicago, and joined Amnesty International, supporting a friend who was starting a campus chapter.

"KCC had such a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere," she said. "I made great friends and had professors who truly cared. My speech class still sticks with me because public speaking is a big part of my job now. And my English Literature professor, Trisha, made learning so engaging."

"The opportunity to help students discover interests and talents they might not have considered is the beauty of a liberal education," Professor Trisha Dandurand said. "Liz's journey really illustrates how college can help students find themselves and chart their own path forward."

Looking back, Liz rates her education at KCC as a five out of five.

"It's a small-town, community feel, but don't underestimate it—it's still college," she said. "You have to be self-disciplined, but the education is just as rigorous as a four-year university. And in the end, you'll feel just as accomplished."
