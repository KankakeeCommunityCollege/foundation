#### What is your favorite memory of KCC?
{: .blue-heading-small}

This may sound weird, but for somebody who has studied mortuary science and works for the coroner’s office I suppose it’s perfectly acceptable… my favorite memory at KCC was working with the cadavers during human anatomy. Many students feared this day in human anatomy lab, but not me! I think I even showed up early out of pure excitement to finally get the chance to put aside a textbook and get a firsthand opportunity to learn from a cadaver. I can still recall the reactions of others and the voice of Professor Bob Ling as he went over the anatomy of the cadaver we studied

#### Tell us about someone who made an impact.

I really learned to appreciate and respect Professor Bob Ling during my two-year stint at KCC. He taught numerous classes I was enrolled in and I always looked forward to his classes and laboratory sessions. His classes were challenging, and he demanded a lot from every student, but if you worked hard and paid attention during his lectures you were destined for success.

#### How did KCC pave the path to where you are today?

As a young adult, deciding on what college to attend is probably one of the most difficult–and yet critical–decisions a person will make in their life. Some choose Ivy League schools, others choose large state universities and then there are those such as myself and millions of others who decide a local community college is the best fit for them. I frequently tell others that starting my secondary education at KCC was one of the best decisions I have ever made and to not get caught up in the hype and luxuries other larger schools can provide.

KCC was the stepping stone that allowed me to enroll in the accelerated mortuary science program at Carl Sandburg College in Galesburg, Illinois. By also going to KCC, I was able to continue to live at home, work two part-time jobs and save thousands of dollars in potential student loan debt. KCC gave me the financial freedom that millions of other college students can only dream of.

In addition to the above, KCC and the dedicated staff provided me with the knowledge and tools necessary to be successful in the future. The KCC motto is “Start Here, Finish Anywhere” and, I promise, if you start here you can finish anywhere.
