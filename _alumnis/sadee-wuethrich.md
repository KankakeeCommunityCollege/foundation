**Helping Children Find Their Voice: Sadee Wuethrich’s Career Dedicated to Supporting Children with Autism**

Sadee Wuethrich helps children with autism build the skills that open doors in school and daily life. As a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, she measures progress, fine tunes interventions, and creates personalized programs that evolve with each child.

“I work with kids with autism in a clinic setting,” Sadee said. “We focus on communication, school readiness, and replacing behaviors that are keeping them from being able to be in a classroom or out in the community.”

Sadee began her college career at Kankakee Community College in the summer of 2018 while still figuring out what she wanted from higher education.

“I didn’t even know if I wanted to go to college yet,” she said. “I started with two summer classes on campus, and I was paying out of pocket, so I wasn’t sure I was going to continue.”

When she visited the college’s South Extension Center in Watseka to pay her tuition, staff introduced her to the newly launched Fast Path program.

“I met Nancy Schunke and Rexann Mckinley, and they told me about Fast Path,” Sadee said. “I signed up and started the following Monday. It was the first cohort they had ever done.”

She completed an associate degree in 2020 as a member of that first Fast Path cohort.

“It was inspiring to watch Sadee grow from an unsure student into a confident young woman with a clear college path and a strong determination to succeed in her chosen profession,” Schunke said. “I have no doubt she will make a meaningful impact on everyone she works with throughout her career.”

Fast Path is now in its 8th year. Students in each cohort take two classes at a time, according to a schedule set in advance for the entire two years. Transfer preparation and a program mentor are also included for academic and personal support.

“It was a much smaller class, and we were all in the same cohort the whole time,” Sadee said. “Rexanne (McKinley) was our mentor, so we could meet with her and talk through what we needed, whether it was school, transferring, or just life. It was very personalized and it really prepared us for moving on to bigger colleges.”

The structure and support changed how Sadee related to school.

“I was never a straight-A student in high school,” she said. “I didn’t really care about school one way or the other. At KCC, I got straight A’s. I became someone who cared about my performance and wanted to do well. That was completely new for me.”

She also credits her instructors for making learning meaningful.

“It was the professors who put in the time and attention,” she said. “They made things interesting and expanded the topics beyond just the textbook. Everyone there was really invested in teaching and in the students.”

Sadee transferred to Governors State University, and earned two bachelor’s degrees, in psychology and dance pedagogy.

Next, Sadee began work on a master’s degree. As a registered behavior technician and later as a supervised trainee, Sadee worked in clinical settings serving children with autism.After completing more than 2,000 supervised hours and passing her state board examination in November 2025, she became a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. She completed a master’s degree in Applied Behavior Analysis at Ball State University in 2024.

She now works at Action Behavior Centers in Elgin.

“I wasn’t even planning on continuing college,” Sadee said. “Fast Path completely changed my direction. It gave me the confidence to keep going and helped me find what I was actually interested in.

“Because I was in the first cohort, I was telling people about it - friends, people in town, my younger sister. It was a really good thing for Watseka because there were already college classes offered there, but Fast Path gave people a real path forward.”

Today, Sadee’s work in behavioral health reflects both her academic training and her commitment to working with people.

“The work ethic I built at KCC carried all the way through,” she said. “It helped me get through my bachelor’s degree, my master’s, and even studying for my state exam.”
