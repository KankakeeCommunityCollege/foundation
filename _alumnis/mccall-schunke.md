**A Voice for Others: McCall Schunke’s Path from KCC to Speech-Language Pathology**

McCall Schunke grew up in Watseka, where close-knit community values and a strong work ethic shaped her early years. After high school, she enrolled at Kankakee Community College and took her first steps toward a career that would help others find their voice.

“I had already completed a good number of dual credit classes through my high school and KCC,” said McCall. “That experience gave me momentum. I was comfortable in the learning environment and confident that I could succeed there.”

McCall earned an Associate of Arts degree from KCC in 2020, and transferred to Southern Illinois University–Edwardsville. After completing a bachelor’s degree in communication sciences and disorders, she remained at SIUE to earn a master’s degree in speech-language pathology. Today, McCall is an elementary school speech-language pathologist in Rantoul School District 137.

“I just finished my first year in the district, and I am loving it,” she said. “It feels good to be doing work that supports kids in meaningful ways.”

At KCC, McCall embraced opportunities for leadership and service. She was active in Phi Theta Kappa honor society and the Student Advisory Council.

“Being on the Student Advisory Council was one of the most memorable parts of my time at KCC,” she said. “We took a trip to meet with student leaders from other community colleges in the region. It was inspiring to share ideas and learn from each other. When we came back, we used that insight to help make KCC a more engaging and supportive place for students.”

She also worked in the college’s accounting office.

“Balancing work and school taught me how to stay organized and focused,” McCall said. “Those skills were incredibly important in grad school and are still important in my clinical work today.”

McCall’s coursework at KCC also helped clarify her career path. A required “Exceptional Learners” course included observational hours in local schools, where she shadowed speech-language pathologists.

“That was my first real look into what the day-to-day work of a speech-language pathologist looks like,” she said. “It confirmed that this was what I wanted to do. Seeing how they adapted their approach for each student made a lasting impression.”

“I'm proud to celebrate a former Exceptional Learner student whose time in our class helped guide her toward her dream career as a Speech Pathologist,” said Jessica Friedericks, professor of education at KCC. “Congratulations on achieving your goal and making a difference!”

Like many students during that time, McCall faced unexpected challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It was an isolating period,” she said. “Everything shifted to remote learning. But KCC responded quickly and provided the support I needed to keep going. That experience taught me a lot about adaptability and staying grounded, even when things change suddenly.”

She credits her instructors and the campus community with helping her grow.

“KCC’s faculty were so supportive,” McCall said. “They took time to answer questions and offered guidance when I needed it. That made a big difference. Their encouragement helped me build academic confidence that I carried with me into my bachelor’s and master’s programs.”

McCall describes the atmosphere at KCC as welcoming and inclusive.

“It is a place where people know you, where you can ask for help, and where you feel like you belong,” McCall said when reflecting on her time at KCC. “There were always opportunities to get involved beyond the classroom.

“KCC was the perfect place for me to begin,”“It helped me become more confident, more prepared, and more connected to what I really wanted to do.”

Her advice for prospective students is simple: “Take advantage of the support. Get involved. The faculty want to see you succeed. And do not be afraid to ask questions. The more you engage, the more you will get out of your experience.”
