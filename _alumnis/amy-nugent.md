**Amy Nugent: Finding Confidence, Community, and Purpose at KCC**

While many of her friends were heading off to four-year universities, Amy Nugent chose a different path—one that felt practical, flexible, and ultimately more empowering.

"I was independent from a young age," Amy said. "I worked through high school and had some savings, but the idea of going away and taking on a huge financial burden just didn’t seem realistic."

As the first in her family to attend college, Amy didn’t have a clear roadmap when she enrolled at Kankakee Community College.

At KCC, Amy joined the Student Advisory Council, helped organize campus and community events, and was selected to serve as the student representative on the Board of Trustees.

"Serving on the Board was intimidating at first," Amy said. "I was only 18, sitting in meetings with adults in suits—but it gave me confidence. I never missed a meeting. I learned how decisions are made and why it matters to have student voices at the table."

Amy credits mentors like the Student Advisory Council adviser, Todd Post, for offering encouragement and guidance during that time. Post was the staff contact for the Student Advisory Council.

Though she began college interested in accounting, her experience at KCC helped her discover a passion for education. After earning an associate degree in 1998, Amy transferred seamlessly to Governors State University to complete a bachelor’s in education.

She then taught first grade in her community for 13 years.

"Looking back, there was a bit of a stigma about staying local," Amy said. "People would say, ‘You’re just going to KCC.’ But I’d do it all over again 100 times. I got the same first two years of education as anyone else, without the debt and with a lot more support."

Today, Amy is a stay-at-home mom with two children and three stepchildren. She is also a  substitute teacher in her district. It's a way to stay connected to teaching and be present for her family.

"KCC gave me direction and confidence at a time I really needed both," she said. "It reminded me that doing what’s right for you, even if it’s not what everyone else is doing, is something to be proud of."
