**LeAnne Mazur: Bridging the Gap Between Art, Design, and Civil Engineering**
 
As she entered college, LeAnne Mazur didn't plan a career in civil engineering.
 
"I always enjoyed science and math in high school, so I thought the medical field was where I was meant to be," said LeAnne. "I started at KCC to become an ultrasound technician, but over time, I realized that my true passion lay elsewhere."
 
LeAnne's role as a student ambassador at Kankakee Community College introduced her to leadership opportunities and networking with faculty and peers. 
 
"Being an ambassador helped me connect with people and learn more about what KCC had to offer beyond my major," she said. "It also taught me the importance of building relationships and advocating for myself."
 
In 2016, after completing a general Associate in Arts degree, LeAnne shifted her focus from healthcare to the creative and technical world of design and decided to start another associate's degree at KCC.
 
"I had always been interested in graphic design, and after completing my initial program, I felt drawn to KCC's Computer Graphic Technology department," LeAnne said. "It gave me the chance to explore CAD (computer-aided drafting), graphic design, and even marketing. At first, I wasn't sure how I'd use those skills, but I loved the creativity and problem-solving involved. That's when my professor, John R. Bordeau, suggested I consider an internship in civil engineering."

"When Piggush Engineering had a civil designer internship available, I knew LeAnne had the skills and knowledge to do the job," Bordeau said. "I approached LeAnne to see if she was interested in the internship. She asked if I thought she could do the job. I told her that she was 100% capable of performing the functions of the job and she would be getting paid for the job over the summer." 

So, in May of 2017, LeAnne kicked off the internship at Piggush Engineering.

"One of her first civil designs was a project across the street from her apartment in Manteno," Bordeau continued. "The job went for bids to be constructed. She watched the project site progress to a completed project from her living room window. It was at that time that she realized that she could improve the quality of life in her own community with her skills that she learned at Kankakee Community College."
 
"It was a great experience," LeAnne said, "Professor Bordeau emphasized the expectations of employers in the field, and I was able to apply them to this internship. I learned how to use engineering tools like the engineering scale and draw with precision, applying what I had learned in a real-world setting."
 
She continued to work at Piggush Engineering while finishing her degree and started a full-time role in December 2017. Since then, she has been promoted to department manager, overseeing a small team of drafters. 
 
"My work revolves around drafting civil roadway plans, designing storm sewers, and collaborating with engineers to create infrastructure plans," LeAnne said. "It's fulfilling because I'm contributing to projects that make a tangible difference in the community."
  
LeAnne excelled in her studies, and in 2019, she earned an associate in applied science degree plus certificates in Computer Graphic Technology and Computer-Aided Drafting. 

LeAnne credits KCC's supportive environment and mentorship with her success. 
 
"KCC allowed me to explore different fields and find my true passion," she said. "The small class sizes allowed for personal attention from professors, and they were always willing to help me succeed."
 
Kris Condon, Ed.D. one of LeAnne's professors, helped her develop key career skills.
 
"Dr. Condon taught me how to write resumes, professional emails, and present myself with confidence," she said. "These skills have been crucial in my career and have helped me navigate the professional world."

LeAnne made the most of every opportunity at KCC. 
 
"Being part of the Technology and Art student club was one of the best experiences of college," she said. "We became a family and even took trips to places like the Art Institute and Maker Lab to explore the intersection of art and technology. It was inspiring to see how my passions for art and design could merge with technology in such impactful ways."
 
Looking back, LeAnne is proud of her unexpected but fulfilling career.
 
"I'm very happy with where I am today," she said. "It wasn't the path I expected, but it led me to a career I truly love. It's full circle now. I've even had the chance to teach a course at KCC on Infrastructure Design with Civil 3D, sharing what I've learned."
 
LeAnne's advice to prospective students is simple: "If you're not sure what you want to do, KCC is a great place to start," she said. "You can explore different fields, save money, and gain practical experience through internships and hands-on learning. And if you change your mind like I did, it's easy to pivot and find a path that fits.
 
"I'll always be grateful for the opportunities KCC gave me. It was the perfect place to figure things out and set me up for success."
