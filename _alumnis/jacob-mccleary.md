**Jacob McCleary&apos;s Journey from Soccer Scholar to Prosthetic Specialist**

After graduating from high school, Jacob McCleary felt overwhelmed by the cost of four-year universities. He considered playing soccer at a Division I or Division II school, but those opportunities didn&apos;t pan out.

Jacob then turned his attention to Kankakee Community College.

"I chose KCC because I knew I could receive a quality education for a fraction of the cost of a four-year university" said Jacob. "Then when I received a scholarship to play soccer at KCC, it affirmed that I had made the right decision." 
Jacob started at KCC in Summer 2016. He earned a transfer degree with a 4.0 grade point average in 2018. He said KCC offered exceptional academic instruction and a supportive community that nurtured his personal and professional&nbsp;growth. 

English professors like Mary Steichen and Amy Porter left a lasting impression with genuine mentorship and support as well as unwavering dedication, he said. 

"The great thing about Jacob is his sense of humor and his willingness to work with and share with others," Porter said. "I loved seeing him in group interactions." 

Jacob&apos;s journey took an unexpected turn during his final soccer season when a nerve injury caused a permanent foot drop. Instead of derailing his dreams, Jacob said the injury introduced him to the fields of orthotics and prosthetics and ignited his passion for helping others.
 
"Through my recovery, I became acquainted with orthotics, initially through my own experience wearing a brace," Jacob said. "This exposure opened my eyes to the realm of prosthetics, and the freedom that braces and prosthetics afford. It was this moment when I decided that&apos;s where I wanted to focus my work â€“ helping others regain mobility and independence through orthotics and prosthetics."
 
After KCC, Jacob completed a bachelor&apos;s degree in biology at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights in 2021. He then completed a master&apos;s degree in prosthetics and orthotics at Northwestern University in Chicago in 2023.
 
Jacob was a member of Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society at KCC. During the 2017-18 academic year, he was recognized for his academic excellence and leadership potential as one of two winners of the All-Illinois Academic Team honor.

"Don&apos;t be afraid to get involved," Jacob said. "As a community college, people think there&apos;s not that many events or student life happening, but KCC really does have an active student life."
 
Jacob encourages potential students to embrace the opportunities at KCC, immerse yourself in the vibrant community, and dare to dream big. Jacob emphasizes the invaluable lessons he learned at KCC, from mastering time management as a student-athlete to embracing the student life and community spirit. 
 
"The classes at KCC prepared me as well as or better than my peers in my subsequent academic work," said Jacob. 
 
Today, Jacob is a resident clinician specializing in prosthetics and orthotics. He is in his final year of residency to become a certified prosthetist and orthotist at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital in Maywood. 
 
"The anatomy I learned at KCC was foundational to what I still know to this day," Jacob said. "It&apos;s something I use every single day."
 
"KCC offers the tools, support, and inspiration to help you realize your fullest potential," he said.
