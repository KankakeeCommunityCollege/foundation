**Crafting Success: Anthony Crite’s Dedication to Family and Trade Education**

Anthony Crite is a business owner and educator whose path is defined by commitment to hard work, a strong sense of family, and a dedication to empowering others through trade education. 

A father of seven and native of Pembroke, Anthony is proud of navigating family life alongside his career.

Anthony’s education journey began when he completed his GED. He attended KCC, initially enrolling in the electrical program before ultimately pursuing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. Anthony earned an HVAC certification in 2018, marking a milestone in his career. Then, he advanced his skills by becoming a licensed plumber in Illinois.

In 2021, Anthony launched his business, Aerial Cooling, Plumbing and Heating, expanding his influence in the trade industry. At the same time, he began working as an adjunct instructor at KCC, where he teaches HVAC skills and mentors students seeking careers in the trades.

"I teach at KCC because I want to give back and help others learn the trade," he explains.

Anthony recalls the sense of achievement he felt when he received his HVAC certification, with his children and family by his side.

"That day was unforgettable; my kids were so proud of me," he shared. "Their encouragement, along with my family’s support, pushed me through working third shift, attending night classes, and long hours of studying."

The support Anthony received from KCC faculty also played a key role in his success.

"The academic guidance and encouragement I received helped me overcome challenging times," Anthony shares. "Without one-on-one help from my teacher and mentor, Charlie Cooke, I might have given up."

Cooke is KCC’s air-conditioning and refrigeration professor.

"There are many words and phrases that can be used to describe Anthony," Cooke said. "Kind, friendly, hardworking, smart, honest, dedicated family man, loving father, but best of all friend. It has been a privilege to know him first as a student, but now as a friend and colleague. Despite the many demands on his time as a father of seven, Anthony remained resolute, balancing his work, education, and family commitments with discipline and perseverance."

Today, Anthony celebrates both his business success and his role as a mentor to KCC students. He values the opportunity to inspire others, especially those considering a career in the trades.

"KCC has a welcoming community, and the instructors genuinely care about your success," he shared, describing the supportive environment that shaped his educational journey.

He encourages students to utilize resources and stay focused, emphasizing that seeking help is a strength, not a weakness.

"Pace yourself, and don’t be afraid to ask for help. It’s all worth it in the end," he advises.

Anthony Crite’s story exemplifies the power of family support, resilience, and a commitment to giving back. His journey serves as a reminder that with dedication and community, achieving your dreams is well within reach.
