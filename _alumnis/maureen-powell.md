I am very fortunate to have had access to Kankakee Community College.  When I was in high school, I applied to, visited, and was accepted by four-year universities.  When I graduated, though, I wasn’t ready to go away to school.  Fortunately, KCC was there.  At the time, not many people I knew were going to KCC.  That turned out to be a good thing, though, because I met new people and made new friends.  I was also able to live at home and work while attending school.  Thanks to the help from a wonderful guidance counselor, Mr. Don James, I received a community college transfer scholarship, which provided full tuition, fees, books, and a mileage stipend to Governors State University, where I completed my bachelor’s degree.
