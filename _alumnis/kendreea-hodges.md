**Compassion in Action: Kendree&apos;a Hodges' Path to Nursing Success**

Growing up in Kankakee, Kendree&apos;a Hodges admired her mother, a dedicated nurse raising four children on her own. Her mother's tenacity and commitment to caring for others inspired Kendree&apos;a at a young age to want to pursue a career in healthcare.

"I was only 13 when I realized I wanted to be a nurse," Kendree&apos;a recalled. "My mom worked at a nursing home and often took me with her when she had to pick up extra shifts. I spent hours talking to the residents, listening to their life stories. That experience solidified my desire to help people."

In 2018, Kendree&apos;a enrolled in the Licensed Practical Nurse program at KCC. At the time, she had three of children of her own, including a one-month-old. A year later, Kendree&apos;a completed her LPN studies and got accepted into the RN program just as her fourth child was born.

Balancing her studies while raising four young children was challenging, but Kendree&apos;a's determination never wavered.

"I didn't sleep much during this time," she said. "I'd get all the kids in bed and then stay up late to get my work done. I'd sneak in sleep wherever I could. It was all about finding balance, which allowed me to perfect my time management skills."

The supportive environment at KCC played a crucial role in Kendree&apos;a's success.

"The professors were incredibly encouraging," she noted. "Having someone to talk to when stressed was what I really needed. One of my instructors, Kim (Brands), always made time to talk and offer advice. She even suggested that other students come to me for help with assignments because she was impressed with my work."

After graduating from KCC in 2021, Kendree&apos;a pursued her bachelor's degree in nursing from Capella University through a self-paced online program. She completed her degree in just three months while working as an RN and caring for her children. "It was intense," she admitted, "but I wrote multiple papers and created PowerPoints daily. I was motivated by my goal of becoming a nurse practitioner."

She earned her Master of Science nurse practitioner degree from Anderson University in South Carolina in 2023, and completed her clinical rotations locally. Kendree&apos;a then started working as a primary care nurse practitioner at Riverside Medical Center Primary Care in Kankakee.

Kendree&apos;a's commitment to her community has always been a driving force.

"I chose KCC because it allowed me to stay local and give back to my community," she said. "Preventative care and patient education are my passions. I love helping people understand the importance of vaccinations, screenings, and overall health."

One of her most memorable projects at KCC involved a car seat safety education initiative.

"As a mom, I wanted to stress the importance of properly securing children in car seats," she explained. "We created posters and presented data on accidents and injuries to the community. It was a fulfilling experience."

Kendree&apos;a credits KCC for laying the foundation of her success. "The hands-on experiences, like the simulation lab, built my confidence and prepared me for real-world nursing," she said. "The supportive faculty and resources were essential in helping me balance my studies and family life. I'm proud to be able to give back to my community and continue the legacy of care that my mother inspired in me.

"I love my job," she said. "Helping patients and making a positive impact on their lives is incredibly rewarding. My journey started at KCC, and I'm grateful for every step along the way."

"I am so proud of my daughter and all of her accomplishments," said Maria Bowles, Kendree'a's mother. "I love that she followed in my footsteps to become a nurse. As a parent, you always want your child to do better than you and Kendree'a has exceeded all of my expectations. Not just in nursing, but in motherhood as well. She completed her schooling with four very young children and did not let that hinder or postpone her dreams."

Kendree&apos;a's advice for anyone considering KCC is "Go for it. KCC offers a lot of resources and help, and everyone there is willing to support you. They make you feel comfortable and are always open and ready to assist you, whether you need support or just a shoulder to lean on. The professors genuinely care about your success."
