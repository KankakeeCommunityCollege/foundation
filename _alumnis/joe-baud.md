**A Change in Course: How Joe Baud Entered the Field of Education**

Growing up in Momence, Joe Baud explored several career options before finding his direction in education. After starting at Parkland College, he enrolled at KCC. He completed prerequisites for the Physical Therapist Assistant program. It was going to be another year before he could advance. At that point, while sitting outside KCC’s advising office, Joe was re-evaluating his plans and “starting to wonder if this was really the right path.” Everything shifted following his next conversation.

“Hey, Joe,” came the greeting. Joe looked up to see Dave Hermann, his former seventh and eighth grade basketball coach and now a KCC advisor. Hermann asked what he was working on, and the conversation led Joe to revisit an interest in teaching. “I had thought about kinesiology and PE years before, but I didn’t know the different routes in education,” Joe said. “Dave really broke it down and showed me options I hadn’t considered.”

Joe changed his major to early childhood education. “Once I started the education classes, it clicked. It made sense for me,” he said.

“I’ve known Joe since he was a young student in Momence, and watching his journey has been incredible,” said Dave Hermann, who has since become a vice president at Washington State College of Ohio. “He has always had a natural ability to connect with others, and his commitment to his students and his community is exactly what we hope for in our graduates. Seeing him grow into a dedicated teacher and respected leader has been truly rewarding, and I couldn’t be more proud of him.”

Joe earned an associate degree from KCC in 2015 and then completed a bachelor’s degree in early childhood education with a special education endorsement at Governors State University in 2017. The same year, he accepted a kindergarten teaching position in the Momence School District, fulfilling what had become a clear goal. “Teaching kindergarten felt natural,” he said. “It was exactly where I wanted to be.”

He spent eight years teaching kindergarten before moving into a new role in 2025 as the special education coordinator for the district. He also expects to complete a master’s degree in educational administration through Grand Canyon University in early 2026. “Stepping into administration is a challenge,” Joe said. “But it’s the right next step for me.”

When reflecting on his time at KCC, Joe consistently returns to one theme: relationships. “I was in a small cohort, and you really got to know the professors,” he said. “They supported you academically, personally, and even after graduation. Those connections helped me get jobs and stay confident.”

He recalled the influence of two faculty members in particular. “Jessica Fredericks taught my first education class,”  Joe said. “She was straightforward and clear, and that made a big impact on how I try to communicate as a teacher.”

“Joe was a fantastic student who brought a positive, high-energy vibe to the classroom,”  Friedericks said. “I knew he would go on to accomplish great things and so look forward to seeing him reach his career milestones.”
 
He also credited Kari Livesey for shaping his early childhood foundation. “She created a calm, real-world learning environment,” Joe said. “She even helped me get my first daycare job so I could build experience.”

“Seeing so many teaching styles helped me decide the kind of educator I wanted to be,” Joe said. “The environment was welcoming, and the activities were creative,” he said, noting that being one of the only men in many of his classes never felt isolating. “We’d role-play preschoolers while practicing lessons. It was funny, but it helped us learn how to manage a real classroom.”

Campus resources also played a key role in his success. “I didn’t have my own computer at the time, so I practically lived in the library and computer labs,” he said. “Anything you needed was available, and the professors made sure you knew where to go for support.”

Joe was named Momence Citizen of the Year in 2021 and he also received an Excellence Award after being nominated for Teacher of the Year. “Those honors meant a lot,” he said. “They reflected the work I put in, but also the foundation KCC helped build.”

He now encourages his own students to consider starting at a community college. “The quality at KCC is top tier,” he said. “People underestimate community colleges, but the professors are knowledgeable, the support is personal, and you get a strong education without the high cost.

“Visit the campus, talk to the staff, and see it for yourself. You’re going to get honest answers and real support. KCC was the starting point for everything I’ve accomplished. I’m grateful I chose it.”
