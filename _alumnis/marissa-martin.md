Marissa Martin's journey into higher education began with a strategic choice—selecting Kankakee Community College for its proximity, flexibility, and the glowing recommendations of friends and family. This decision became the foundation for both her personal and professional growth.

Choosing KCC enabled Marissa to remain close to home and maintain a flexible course schedule that accommodated work commitments and other responsibilities alongside her studies. The supportive atmosphere, coupled with smaller class sizes, further solidified her choice.

"At KCC, the professors took a genuine interest in each student,” Marissa recalls. “They all knew my name and that created a sense of support and encouragement. I knew exactly who to turn to with my questions. The faculty guided me to not only just pass my classes, but also to understand the requirements for a successful transfer."

Marissa completed an Associate in General Studies degree in 2010. She went on to Dominican University in River Forest, earning both a bachelor’s degree in corporate communications and a master’s degree in library and information sciences.

Currently serving as an operations manager for a Interim HealthCare in Merrillville, Indiana, Marissa attributes her success to the foundation laid during her time at KCC.

At KCC, Marissa said she encountered dedicated and enthusiastic professors who left a lasting impact. One notable example was her economics professor, who recognized the difficulties of a particularly challenging subject and proactively set up after-class sessions.

"I struggled with economics, and our professor noticed many classmates shared the same struggle,” Marissa shared. “Instead of waiting for students to reach out individually, she made herself available for extra sessions after class to ensure everyone had a chance to grasp the concepts together. It was a collective effort to overcome a complex subject."

Beyond the classroom, Marissa found that KCC taught her invaluable life lessons.

"KCC taught me to trust my instincts,” Marissa acknowledges. “It was a period of personal growth where I learned to make decisions based on what felt right for me, not necessarily what others expected. It was about finding my own personal path.

"KCC prepared me for the challenges ahead. It was a stepping stone that eased me into college life and taught me the importance of setting goals and meeting them. The college environment allowed me to learn the balance I needed to be well-prepared for life."

Marissa dispels any stigma associated with attending a community college close to home, highlighting the unique advantages it offers, especially for those not ready to venture far.

"If you're thinking about KCC, go there, talk to people, and walk around campus,” Marissa encourages. “KCC was a great stepping stone for me, and it could be for you, too. It's about trusting your journey, setting goals, and knowing that KCC is a place that prepares you for an 'onward and upward' trajectory."

Marissa's journey at KCC exemplifies the transformative power of a supportive community-driven education, proving that KCC is not just a college, but a launchpad for personal and professional success.
