**Nanci Ramirez: From KCC Student to Police Officer**

Nanci Ramirez didn't just become a police officer—she became a force for change in law enforcement.

On the Momence Police Department, Nanci makes empathy, understanding, and true service to the community her priorities.

"Policing should be customer-oriented," Nanci said. "People assume it's just about enforcing the law, but it's just as much about listening, helping, and guiding people in difficult moments."

Before earning her associate degree in law enforcement at KCC in 2024, she spent more than 20 years in customer service. Working in hairstyling, banking, and the restaurant industry, Nanci developed skills in communication, problem-solving, and patience—qualities she now uses every day as an officer.

Nanci was also employed by the Kankakee Sheriff's Police in a customer service role for four years. Surrounded by officers, her long-standing interest in law enforcement reignited. She enrolled in KCC's night classes while working there full-time.

"I started with just two classes, afraid it would be overwhelming," Nanci said. "But I kept pushing myself. Looking back, I don't know how I managed it all, but I was determined to get through."

After graduation, she briefly served as a deputy. Then, in August 2024, Nanci joined the Momence Police Department.

"I love my job because I get to interact with people in a way that makes a difference," she said. "Sometimes, instead of judgment, people just need a little faith, knowledge, or guidance. If I can help even one person make a better choice, it's all worth it."

KCC provided financial support and encouragement, Nanci said. She received the Rittmanic-Bailey Scholarship twice. It honors fallen Bradley Police Sgt. Marlene Rittmanic and wounded Bradley Police (Retired) Sgt. Tyler Bailey. Nancy also received the Jimenez Challenge Scholarship while at KCC.

"KCC's faculty and staff didn't just support me—they empowered me," Nanci said. “They connected me with critical resources, championed my potential, and fostered a learning environment where I felt truly seen, heard, and inspired to succeed."

That same mindset of support and understanding now guides Nanci as a police officer.

"There's a common misconception that police officers have to be tough and unemotional," she said. "But compassion is just as important. My years in customer service taught me to listen before reacting. Taking the time to hear someone's story makes all the difference.

"KCC made my dream a reality. I found my passion, recognized a need, and followed through. If you feel called to serve, to make a difference, don't wait. You don't need to follow a traditional path. You just need to start."
