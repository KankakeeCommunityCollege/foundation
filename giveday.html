               <p class="typography__larger-p"><em>&ldquo;The money aspect of a college education has always been a factor
                 contributing to when and where I could go to further my education, but that has not stopped me. As an
                 immigrant, things are not always at one's leisure, after high school I did not know what I was going to
                 do because I knew financial aids like FAFSA were not a possibility and I did not believe at the time
                 that there was assistance for immigrants. I was fortunate enough to be accepted for the Deferred Action
                 for childhood Arrivals, also known as DACA, which I am grateful for and it did open doors of
                 possibilities that I did not have before.
                 Such opportunities as being able to have a job and attending college. DACA has allowed me to have a job
                 that then allowed me to finance my first associate degree at Kankakee Community College. By me being
                 able to work I have had the opportunity to pay for school on my own. I am the first in my family to
                 attend college, have any degree and have so far financed that through my own labor in hopes of one day
                 having a career in the law field as a paralegal or attorney. My financial need for attending college is
                 urgent and full of opportunity for my future.&rdquo;</em> &#8209;&nbsp;Victor&nbsp;M.</p>
